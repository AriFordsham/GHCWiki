= Travis =

Travis-CI is a free-for-open-source continuous integration service.

== What does it do? ==

It watches the [[Repositories|repository]] for new commits (any branch) and validate it using the instructions in [[source:ghc/.travis.yml]]. It presents the results on https://travis-ci.org/ghc/ghc/builds, where you can see the status of recent builds and look at the logs. 

== What is validated ==

Because of time constraints, not a full validation run is done. Instead
 * only static libraries are built,
 * GHC is linked statically,
 * the test suite is run in “fast” mode,
 * all performance tests are skipped,
 * and neither haddock nor documentation is built.

It does all this in two variants
 * without `-DDEBUG`, to match what we release, and
 * with `-DDEBUG`, to catch assertions.

These settings are made in [[source:ghc/.travis.yml]]. You can experiment with different settings in a `wip/...` branch.

== Statuses ==

 * '''Success''' (green checkmark):

 The validation run went through without problems. Great!
 * '''Failure''' (Red cross):

 There was a validation error, such as a build failure or a failing test case. Go and fix it!
 * '''Error''' (Grey exclamation mark): Travis could not finish the build. Most often, this is due to the build exceeding the time limit of 50 minutes. 
   
 In that case, you can probably ignore the problem. If you are a [https://github.com/orgs/ghc/members|member of the GitHub GHC team], you can restart the build, to keep the build history tidy.

== Mail status ==

Travis is not 100% reliable for as, as we occasionally hit the time limit. Therefore, mails about failing reports are sent to Joachim and the [[MailingListsAndIRC|ghc-builds]] mailing lists. If we can improve this, we could make Travis send mails directly to the commiter.

Again, this is configured in [[source:ghc/.travis.yml]]. This also means that if you have a long-living feature branch you can put your own address in the file.


== Viewing the build log ==

GHC build logs are huge, and the JavaScript-based viewer that Travis uses by default will easily choke your browser when trying to display them. The trick is to quickly click the “Download Log” button in the top right corner (a square with horizontal lines, [[Image(https://travis-ci.org/images/icons/logs.svg, height=10)]]). This will open the log as a plain text file
