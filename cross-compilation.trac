= Cross Compiling GHC =

As of this moment (GHC 6.12) GHC does not support cross-compilation.  There are reasons that we would like it to:

 * [http://takeoffgw.sourceforge.net/ TakeoffGW] is a distribution of Unix tools for Windows, built by cross-compiling on a Linux machine.  They would like to be able to build and distribute GHC this way.  It might be useful for us to be able to cross-compile a Windows GHC from Linux too.

 * We could build a 64-bit GHC on OS X, by cross-compiling using the 32-bit version.

 * We could port to Win64 (#1884) by cross-compiling using a 32-bit Windows GHC.

 * Other porting tasks might be easier, given a suitable cross-compilation toolchain.


== Plan ==

Here is how it should work:

{{{
$ ./configure --build=<here> --host=<there> --target=<there>
}}}

note that we're cross-compiling from the ''build'' machine to the ''host'' machine.  The ''target'' machine is the same as the ''host'': the GHC that we're trying to create will generate binaries for ''host''.

No doubt we'll also need to specify some additional configuration parameters to tell the build system where to find our cross-compilation tools.  Perhaps something like

{{{
--with-host-cc=...
--with-host-as=...
--with-host-ld=...
--with-host-ar=...
--with-host-strip=...
}}}

 * stage 1: runs on `build`, compiles for `host`
 * stage 2: runs on `host`, compiles for `host`

== Things that probably need fixing ==

 * The configure script doesn't let you specify different `build`, `host`, and `target` right now
 * The build systme has no distinction between the gcc used to compile from build->build and build->host.
 * We can't build anything with stage2 when cross-compiling, e.g. Haddock and DPH must be disabled.
