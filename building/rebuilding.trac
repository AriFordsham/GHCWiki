= How do I rebuild GHC after updating or changing it? =

Note that after pulling new changes, the safest way to continue working is to clean the build tree and start from scratch:

{{{
  $ make distclean
  $ autoreconf
  $ ./configure
  $ make
}}}

You may be able to shortcut this procedure if you know what you're doing, or you could just take a risk and if anything goes wrong fall back to the above procedure.
