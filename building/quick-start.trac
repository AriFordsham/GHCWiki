  "I just want to build it!"

No problem.  This recipe should build and install a working GHC with
all the default settings.  (unless you're on Windows, in which case go
to [wiki:Building/Windows]).

If you are starting from a {{{darcs}}} checkout, then first of all:

{{{
$ autoreconf
}}}

(this step isn't necessary if you have a source distribution).

Now, everybody:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
}}}

For GHC, this will do a 2-stage bootstrap build of the compiler, with
profiling libraries, and install the results in the default location
(under {{{/usr/local}}} on Unix, for example).

The {{{configure}}} script is a standard GNU
{{{autoconf}}} script, and accepts the usual options for
changing install locations and the like.  Run
{{{./configure --help}}} for a list of
options.

If you want to do anything at all non-standard, or you
want to do some development, read on...
