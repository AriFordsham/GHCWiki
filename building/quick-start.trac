= Quick Start to just building and installing GHC =

Below are quick instructions for '''just building and installing GHC'''. For instructions on how to use the build system as a '''developer''', go to the [wiki:Newcomers Newcomers page].

The following instructions assume that you have [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources got the sources] and [wiki:Building/Preparation installed the necessary tools].

If you are starting from a `git` checkout then:

{{{
$ ./boot
}}}

(this step isn't necessary if you have a source distribution).

Next on non-Windows:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
}}}

On Windows:

NOTE: On Windows you need to download some binary distributables before being able to build.
This only has to be done once and can be done by adding a flag to the call to configure
{{{
$ ./configure --enable-tarballs-autodownload
$ make
$ make install
}}}



This will do a 2-stage bootstrap build of the compiler, with profiling libraries, and install the results in the default location (under {{{/usr/local}}} on Unix, for example).

The {{{configure}}} script is a standard GNU {{{autoconf}}} script, and accepts the usual options for changing install locations and the like.  Run {{{./configure --help}}} for a list of options.

'''NOTE''': ''If you had to install Happy and/or Alex using cabal you will need to override your PATH so cabal's version of happy and alex are used instead of the system versions.''
{{{
$ PATH=/home/user/.cabal/bin:$PATH ./configure
$ make
$ make install
}}}
