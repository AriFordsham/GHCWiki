  "I just want to build it!"

No problem.  This recipe should build and install a working GHC with
all the default settings.

The following instructions assume that you have [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources got the sources] (note: not just a `darcs get`) and [wiki:Building/Preparation installed the necessary tools].

If you are starting from a {{{darcs}}} checkout(or rebuilding from darcs), then:

{{{
$ sh boot
}}}

(this step isn't necessary if you have a source distribution).

Windows users:

{{{
$ ./configure --host=i386-unknown-mingw32
      --with-gcc=c:/mingw/bin/gcc
      --with-ld=c:/mingw/bin/ld.exe
}}}

where `c:/mingw` should be replaced by the place you installed MinGW, if you installed it somewhere other than the default.

Non-Windows users can just say:

{{{
$ ./configure
}}}

Now everybody:

{{{
$ make
$ make install
}}}

This will do a 2-stage bootstrap build of the compiler, with
profiling libraries, and install the results in the default location
(under {{{/usr/local}}} on Unix, for example).

The {{{configure}}} script is a standard GNU
{{{autoconf}}} script, and accepts the usual options for
changing install locations and the like.  Run
{{{./configure --help}}} for a list of
options.

If you want to do anything at all non-standard, or you
want to do some development, read on...
