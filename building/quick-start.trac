= Quick Start to just building GHC =

Below are quick instructions for '''just building and installing GHC'''. If you are an aspiring GHC developer, read the [wiki:Newcomers Newcomers] page instead.

The following instructions assume that you have [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources got the sources] and [wiki:Building/Preparation installed the necessary tools].

If you are starting from a `git` checkout then:

{{{
$ ./boot
}}}

(this step isn't necessary if you have a source distribution).

Next on non-Windows:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
}}}

On Windows:

NOTE: On Windows you need to download some binary distributables before being able to build.
This only has to be done once and can be done by adding a flag to the call to configure
{{{
$ ./configure --enable-tarballs-autodownload
$ make
}}}

This will do a 2-stage bootstrap build of the compiler, with profiling libraries.

== Run without installing ==

You can find the binaries built by make in `inplace` directory under the root of the ghc source tree. The binaries can be run from here without installing.

== Installing ==

After building, to install GHC (by default in `/usr/local`):

{{{
$ make install
}}}
