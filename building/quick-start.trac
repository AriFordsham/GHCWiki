= Quick Start: Just building and installing GHC =

Below are quick instructions for '''just building and installing GHC'''. For instructions on how to '''working on GHC''' start over [wiki:Building/Hacking here].

The following instructions assume that you have [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources got the sources] (note: not just a `git clone`) and [wiki:Building/Preparation installed the necessary tools].

If you are starting from a `git` checkout then:

{{{
$ perl boot
}}}

(this step isn't necessary if you have a source distribution).

Next:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
}}}

This will do a 2-stage bootstrap build of the compiler, with profiling libraries, and install the results in the default location (under {{{/usr/local}}} on Unix, for example).

The {{{configure}}} script is a standard GNU {{{autoconf}}} script, and accepts the usual options for changing install locations and the like.  Run {{{./configure --help}}} for a list of options.

If you want to do anything at all non-standard, or you want to do some development, read on...
