In order to create directories, we use "order-only" make dependencies, e.g.
{{{
build/foo.o : foo.c foo.h | $$(dir $$@)/.
    gcc $< -o $@
}}}
Dependencies after the `|` are order-only, i.e. we only require that the directory exists, not that `build/foo.o` is newer than it. The doubled-dollars are because this needs to happen during the second-expansion phase, as $@ is not available during the first-expansion.
