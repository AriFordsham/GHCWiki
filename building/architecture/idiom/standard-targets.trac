We want an `all` target that builds everything, but we also want a way to build individual components (say, everything in `rts/`).  This is achieved by having a separate "all" target for each directory, named `all_`''directory''.  For example in `rts/ghc.mk` we might have this:

{{{
all : all_rts
.PHONY all_rts
all_rts : ...dependencies...
}}}
When the top level '''make''' includes all these `ghc.mk` files, it will see that target `all` depends on `all_rts, all_ghc, ...etc...`; so `make all` will make all of these.  But the individual targets are still available.  In particular, you can say
  * `make all_rts` (anywhere) to build everything in the RTS directory
  * `make all` (anywhere) to build everything
  * `make`, with no explicit target, makes the default target in the current directory's stub `Makefile`, which in turn makes the target `all_`''dir'', where ''dir'' is the current directory.

Other standard targets such as `clean`, `install`, and so on use the same technique.  There are pre-canned macros to define your "all" and "clean" targets, take a look in `rules/all-target.mk` and `rules/clean-target.mk`.
