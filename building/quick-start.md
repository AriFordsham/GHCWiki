# Quick Start to just building GHC


Below are quick instructions for **just building and installing GHC**. If you are an aspiring GHC developer, read the [Newcomers](newcomers) page instead.


The following instructions assume that you have [got the sources](building/getting-the-sources) and [installed the necessary tools](building/preparation).  In particular for Windows users, all the commands below must be executed in the MinGW shell, not Command Prompt or PowerShell.


Optionally, you customize your build by creating the file `mk/build.mk` using `mk/build.mk.sample` as a template.


If you obtained the repository via `git clone --recursive`, you will need to first run:

```
$ ./boot
```

<sub>This step isn't necessary if you obtained the source from a tar archive.</sub>


Next, run the `./configure` script followed by `make` to start the build:

```
$ ./configure # Windows users must append "--enable-tarballs-autodownload"
$ make
```

<sub>On Windows you need to download some binary distributables before being able to build.  This only has to be done once and can be done by adding the `--enable-tarballs-autodownload` flag to the call to `./configure`.</sub>


By default (without any `mk/build.mk` customization), this will do a 2-stage bootstrap build of the compiler, with profiling libraries.

## Run without installing


You can find the binaries built by make in the `inplace/bin` directory under the root of the ghc source tree. The binaries can be run from here without installing.

## Installing


After building, to install GHC (by default in `/usr/local`):

```
$ make install
```


You may need to use `sudo`.
