# Adding new test cases


This section gives an overview of how to add new test cases to the testsuite. First we give an overview of how the testsuite is designed.

## Testsuite Design Overview


The testsuite is designed largely as follows, where we take the root of the testsuite to be `testsuite/`. Firstly we have the individual test cases to run. Each test case though can be run in multiple ways. These different ways (which are simply called ```ways```) correspond to things like different optimisation levels, using the threaded RTS or not... ect. Some test cases can be run in any way while others are specific to certain ways. The general layout of the testsuite is this:

- `config`: Contains the definition of the different ways supported. The only file of relevance here is `ghc`. No other Haskell compiler is actually supported by the testsuite.
- `driver`: Contains the python source code that forms the testsuite framework.
- `mk`: Contains the make source code that forms the testsuite framework. The make part is mostly concerned with invoking the python component, which does the actual work.
- `tests`: Contains the actual test cases to run.
- `timeout`: Contains a Haskell program that kills a running test case after a certain amount of time. Used by the testsuite framework.

## Adding a test case


For adding any test case, follow these guide lines and then refer to the more specific examples below for a single module test case and a multiple module test case. All test cases should reside under the \`testsuite/tests/ghc-regress/' directory. From now on we assume that directory as our root.

1. Find the appropriate place for the test case. The GHC regression suite
  is generally organised in a "white-box" manner: a regression which
  originally illustrated a bug in a particular part of the compiler
  is placed in the directory for that part.  For example, typechecker
  regression test cases go in the typechecker/ directory, parser test
  cases go in parser/, and so on.

> > **should_fail**: test cases which should fail to compile and generate a particular error message

1. Having found a suitable place for the test case, give the test case a name.
  For regression test cases, we often just name the test case after the bug
  number (e.g. T2047).  Alternatively, follow the convention for the directory
  in which you place the test case: for example, in typecheck/should_compile,
  test cases are named tc001, tc002, and so on.  Suppose you name your test
  case T, then you'll have the following files:

> > > (eg. absolute pathnames are removed, whitespace
> > > differences are ignored, etc.)

1. Edit all.T in the relevant directory and add a line for the test case.  The line is always of the form

  ```wiki
  test(<name>, <setup>, <test-fn>, <args...>)
  ```

  The format of this line is explained in more detail below as it differs for test case types.
  It allows you to say if the test case should fail to compile, run fine, run but terminate
  with a certain exit code... ect. The \<args...\> argument is a list argument, where the length
  and format of the list depends on the \<test-fn\> you use. The choice of \<test-fn\> is largely
  dependent on how complex it is to build you test case. The \<test-fn\> specifies a build method
  more then anything else.

### A single module test case


A single module test case is very easy. Simply name the Haskell source files the same as your test
name (so T.hs in our running example).


Then for a test case that should compile and run fine we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('cgrun001', normal, compile_and_run, [''])
```


For a test case that should compile but you don't want run, we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('cg002', normal, compile, [''])
```


For a test case that should fail during compilation we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('drvfail001', normal, compile_fail, [''])
```


For more detailed control of a test case, see below. \\REF

### A multiple module test case


A multiple module test case is slightly more complex then a single module one. Firstly we a concerned with how to handle the simplest form of a multiple module test case, that is one where the whole test case can be built in one go using the `--make` command of GHC. If you have more complex needs (like compiling source files that `--make` can't handle, and/or need to compile different modules with different GHC arguments, then see below \\REF)


Then for a test case that should compile and run fine we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test(multimod001, normal, multimod_compile_and_run, \
              [ 'Main', '-fglasgow-exts', ''])
```


This example would compile a multiple module test case where the top module is Main.hs and `-fglasgow-exts` is passed to GHC when compiling.


For a test case that should compile but you don't want run, we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('T3286', extra_clean(['T3286b.o','T3286b.hi']), 
              multimod_compile, ['T3286', '-v0'])
```


This example would compile a multiple module test case where the top module is T3286 and before compiling the test the files T3286b.o and T3286b.hi are removed.


For a test case that should fail during compilation we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('Over',
     extra_clean(['OverA.hi', 'OverA.o',
                  'OverB.hi', 'OverB.o',
                  'OverC.hi', 'OverC.o']),
     multimod_compile_fail,
     ['OverD', '-no-hs-main -c -v0'])
```

### Advanced multiple module test cases


If you have a test case that can't be built with the simpler two methods described above then you should try one of the methods described below. The build method below allows you to explicitly provide a list of source files that GHC should try to build. They are also built in the order you specify. This is useful for test cases say that use a .cmm source file or .c source file, these are files that GHC can build but aren't picked up by `--make`.


The more advanced method comes in two forms of \<test-fn\>'s. The first one is `mutlisrc_compile...` and the other one is `multi_...`. They differ only in that the later method allows you to not only list individual files for GHC to compile but also allows you to set arguments that should be passed to GHC when compiling a specific file. The `multisrc_compile...` method only allows arguments to GHC to be set globally for all files. Below are some examples of how to use these two \<test-fn\>


Then for a test case that should compile and run fine we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('cgrun069', omit_ways(['ghci']), multisrc_compile_and_run,
                 ['cgrun069', ['cgrun069_cmm.cmm'], ''])

```


This test case relies on a .cmm file, hence it can't use the simpler `multimod_compile_and_run` \<test-fn\>. We also see here how we can stop a test case running in a certain WAY.


For a test case that should compile but you don't want run, we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('Check02', normal, multisrc_compile, ['Check02', ['Check02_A.hs', 'Check02_B.hs'], '-trust base'])
```


OR equivalently we could use the `multi_compile` version and just pass no extra arguments to the specific files to compile:

```wiki
test('Check02', normal, multi_compile, ['Check02', [
                                       ('Check02_A.hs', ''),
                                       ('Check02_B.hs', '')
                                       ], '-trust base'])
```


For a test case that should fail during compilation we would put this line in all.T:

```wiki
test('Check01', normal, multi_compile_fail, ['Check01', [
                                            ('Check01_A.hs', ''),
                                            ('Check01_B.hs', '-trust base')
                                            ], ''])
```


This test case must use the `multi_compile_fail` method as it relies on being able to compile the file Check01_B.hs with the argument '-trust base' but not compile any of the other files with this flag.

## Format of the test entries in all.T


Each test in a `test.T` file is specified by a line the form

```wiki
test(<name>, <setup>, <test-fn>, <args...>)
```


Where \<args...\> is a list of arguments.

### The \<name\> field

*\<name\>* is the name of the test, in quotes (' or ").

### The \<setup\> field

*\<setup\>*  is a function (i.e. any callable object in Python)
which allows the options for this test to be changed.
There are many pre-defined functions which can be
used in this field:

- **normal**                don't change any options from the defaults
- **skip**                  skip this test
- **skip_if_no_ghci**       skip unless GHCi is available

- **skip_if_fast**          skip if "fast" is enabled

- **omit_ways(ways)**       skip this test for certain ways

- **only_ways(ways)**       do this test certain ways only

- **extra_ways(ways)**      add some ways which would normally be disabled

- **omit_compiler_types(compilers)**                           skip this test for certain compilers

- **only_compiler_types(compilers)**       do this test for certain compilers only

- **expect_broken(bug)** this test is a expected not to work due to the indicated trac bug number

- **expect_broken_for(bug, ways)** as expect_broken, but only for the indicated ways

- **if_compiler_type(compiler_type, f)** Do `f`, but only for the given compiler type

- **if_platform(plat, f)**  Do `f`, but only if we are on the specific platform given

- **if_tag(tag, f)**        do `f` if the compiler has a given tag

- **unless_tag(tag, f)**    do `f` unless the compiler has a given tag

- **set_stdin(file)**       use a different file for stdin

- **no_stdin**              use no stdin at all (otherwise use `/dev/null`)

- **exit_code(n)**          expect an exit code of 'n' from the prog

- **extra_run_opts(opts)**  pass some extra opts to the prog

- **no_clean**              don't clean up after this test

- **extra_clean(files)**    extra files to clean after the test has completed

- **reqlib(P)**             requires package P

- **req_profiling**         requires profiling

- **ignore_output**         don't try to compare output

- **alone**                 don't run this test in parallel with anything else

- **literate**              look for a `.lhs` file instead of a `.hs` file

- **c_src**                 look for a `.c` file

- **cmd_prefix(string)**    prefix this string to the command when run

- **normalise_slashes**     convert backslashes to forward slashes before comparing the output


The following should normally not be used; instead, use the `expect_broken*`
functions above so that the problem doesn't get forgotten about, and when we
come back to look at the test later we know whether current behaviour is why
we marked it as expected to fail:

- **expect_fail**           this test is an expected failure, i.e. there is a known bug in the compiler, but we don't want to fix it.

- **expect_fail_for(ways)** expect failure for certain ways 


To use more than one modifier on a test, just put them in a list.
For example, to expect an exit code of 3 and omit way 'opt', we could use

```wiki
[ omit_ways(['opt']), exit_code(3) ]
```


as the `<setup>` argument.

### The \<test-fn\> field

*\<test-fn\>* is a function which describes how the test should be
built and maybe run. It also determines the number of arguments for
\<args...\>.  Each function comes in three forms:

- `test-fn`: Compiles the program, expecting compilation to succeed.
- `test-fn_fail`: Compiles the program, expecting compilation to fail.
- `test-fn_and_run`: Compiles the program, expecting it to succeed, and then runs the program.


The test functions mostly differ in how the compile the test case. The simplest
test functions can only compile single file test cases, while the most complex
test function can compile a multi file test case with different flags for each
file. The possible test functions are:

- **compile**, **compile_fail**, **compile_and_run**: 

  This is the simplest test function and can only handle compiling a single module test case.
  The source file to compile must correspond to the \<name\> of the test.

> *\<args...\> = \[\<extra_hc_opts\>\]*

>
> Where:
>
> > *\<extra_hc_opts\>*: arguments to pass to GHC when it compiles your test case.

- **multimod_compile**, **multimod_compile_fail**, **multimod_compile_and_run**: 

  Compile a multi-module program using the GHC `--make` build system.

> *\<args...\> = \[\<topmod\>, \<extra_hc_opts\>\]*

>
> Where:
>
> > *\<topmod\>*: The top level source file for your test case. 
> > *\<extra_hc_opts\>*: arguments to pass to GHC when it compiles your test case.

- **multisrc_compile**, **multisrc_compile_fail**, **multisrc_compile_and_run**: 

  Compile a multi source test case. This is for cases where the GHC `--make` build system is
  not enough, such as when you first need to compile a .c or .cmm file before compiling the
  Haskell top level module.

> *\<args...\> = \[\<topmod\>, \[\<extra_mods\>\], \<extra_hc_opts\>\]*

>
> Where:
>
> > *\<topmod\>*: The top level source file for your test case. 
> > *\[\<extra_mods\>\]*: A list of other source files that GHC should compile before compiling \<topmod\>. 
> > *\<extra_hc_opts\>*: arguments to pass to GHC when it compiles your test case.

- **multi_compile**, **multi_compile_fail**, **multi_compile_and_run**: 

  This is essentially the same as `multisrc_compile...` but also allows arguments to GHC to be set
  for individual files to be compiled, not just globally as \<extra_hc_opts\> is.

> *\<args...\> = \[\<topmod\>, \[(\<extra_mod\>, \<hc_opts\>)\], \<extra_hc_opts\>\]*

>
> Where:
>
> > *\<topmod\>*: The top level source file for your test case. 
> > *\[(\<extra_mod\>, \<hc_opts\>)\]*: A list of tuples where the first element is a source file for GHC to compile and the second element are arguments GHC should use to compile that particular source file. 
> > *\<extra_hc_opts\>*: arguments to pass to GHC when it compiles your test case (applied to all source files).

- **compile_and_run_with_prefix**
  Same as compile_and_run, but with command to use to run the execution of the result binary.

- **multimod_compile_and_run_with_prefix**
  Same as multimod_compile_and_run, but with command to use to run the execution of the result binary.

- **run_command**
  Just run an arbitrary command.  The output is checked
  against `T.stdout` and `T.stderr` (unless `ignore_output`
  is used), and the stdin and expected exit code can be
  changed in the same way as for compile_and_run.  NB: run_command only works 
  in the **normal** way, so don't use **only_ways** with it.

- **ghci_script**
  Runs the current compiler, passing
  --interactive and using the specified
  script as standard input.

## Sample output files


Normally, the sample `stdout` and `stderr` for a test T go in the
files `T.stdout` and `T.stderr` respectively.  However, sometimes a
test may generate different output depending on the platform,
compiler, compiler version, or word-size.  For this reason the test
driver looks for sample output files using this pattern:

```wiki
T.stdout[-<compiler>][-<version>][-ws-<wordsize>][-<platform>]
```


Any combination of the optional extensions may be given, but they must
be in the order specified.  The most specific output file that matches
the current configuration will be selected; for example if the
platform is `i386-unknown-mingw32` then `T.stderr-i386-unknown-mingw32`
will be picked in preference to `T.stderr`.


Another common example is to give different sample output for an older
compiler version.  For example, the sample `stderr` for GHC 6.8.x would go in the file
`T.stderr-ghc-6.8`.
