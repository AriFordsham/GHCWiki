= Updating test cases when the output changes =

If the output of a test has changed, but the new output is still
correct, you can automatically update the sample output to match the
new output like so:
{{{
$ make accept TEST=<test-name>
}}}
where <test-name> is the name of the test. 

If you want to update a whole directory of tests to accept the
new output, simply call `make accept` in that directory:
{{{
$ cd array/should_run
$ make accept
}}}
