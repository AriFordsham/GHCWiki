= Updating test cases when the output changes =

If the output of a test has changed, but the new output is still
correct, you can automatically update the sample output to match the
new output like so:
{{{
$ make accept TEST=<test-name>
}}}
where <test-name> is the name of the test. 

If you want to update a whole directory of tests to accept the
new output, simply call `make accept` in that directory:
{{{
$ cd array/should_run
$ make accept
}}}
== Performance tests ==

Some of the performance tests in `perf/` check for peak memory usage.  Peak memory usage is obtained when there is a major GC, so the peak value can be vulnerable to the timing of major GC.  If `peak_megabytes` appears to increase, try running with `RTS -h -i0.01` before and after. That makes major GC happen more often, and gives a much more accurate result.
