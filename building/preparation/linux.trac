= Setting up a Linux system for building GHC =

If you're on a recent Linux system, then you should be able to get a working build environment by installing the following packages using your system's package manager.

== Fedora ==

 * `glibc-devel`
 * `ncurses-devel`
 * `gmp-devel`
 * `autoconf`
 * `automake`
 * `libtool`
 * `gcc`
 * `make`
 * `perl`
 * `python`
 * `ghc`
 * `happy`
 * `alex`
 * `git`

For building the documentation: (User's Guide and Cabal guide):

 * `docbook-utils`
 * `docbook-utils-pdf`
 * `docbook-style-xsl`

other packages that are useful for development:

 * `strace`
 * `patch`

== Debian-based systems (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu) ==

You can make sure you have all dependencies by

    `apt-get build-dep ghc6`

But this might install some packages you do not use in your system (e.g. lintian).  Alternatively install the following:

 * `haskell-platform`
 * `git`
 * `autoconf`
 * `libtool`
 * `make`

 * `automake`
 * `perl`
 * `python`

For building the documentation: (User's Guide and Cabal guide):

 * `docbook-utils`
 * `dblatex`

other packages that are useful for development:

 * `strace`
 * `patch`
 * `linux-tools-<version>` (includes `perf`, see [wiki:Debugging/LowLevelProfiling/Perf])
