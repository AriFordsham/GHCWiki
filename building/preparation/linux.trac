If you're on a recent Linux system, then you should be able to get a working build environment by installing the following packages using your system's package manager:

 * `glibc-devel`
 * `libedit-devel`
 * `ncurses-devel`
 * `gmp-devel`
 * `autoconf`
 * `automake`
 * `libtool`
 * `gcc`
 * `make`
 * `perl`
 * `python` (only needed for the testsuite)
 * `ghc` (recent stable version of ghc, not a development version)
 * `happy`
 * `alex`

To be able to build the documentation (User's Guide and Cabal guide):

 * `docbook-utils`
 * `docbook-utils-pdf`
 * `docbook-style-xsl`

other packages that are useful for development:

 * `strace`
 * `patch`
 * `libcurl-devel` and `zlib-devel` (for building darcs)
