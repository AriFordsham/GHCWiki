= Setting up a Linux system for building GHC =

If you're on a recent Linux system, then you should be able to get a working build environment by installing the following packages using your system's package manager.

== Fedora ==

 * `glibc-devel`
 * `ncurses-devel`
 * `gmp-devel`
 * `autoconf`
 * `automake`
 * `libtool`
 * `gcc`
 * `make`
 * `perl`
 * `python`
 * `ghc`
 * `happy`
 * `alex`
 * `git`

For building the documentation: (User's Guide and Cabal guide):

 * `docbook-utils`
 * `docbook-utils-pdf`
 * `docbook-style-xsl`

other packages that are useful for development:

 * `strace`
 * `patch`

== Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based systems ==

If you are building GHC >7.6 on Debian 7.0 (wheezy) you will need to install an updated version of happy (>=1.19) which is available in sid and has not migrated to jessie as of  2013-09-25.

You can make sure you have all dependencies by

{{{
   sudo apt-get build-dep ghc6
}}}

But this might install some packages you do not use in your system (e.g. java, docbook, xsltproc).  Alternatively install the following:

{{{
   sudo apt-get install haskell-platform git autoconf libtool make ncurses-dev g++
}}}

(`ncurses-dev` is needed by the `terminfo` package, and `g++` is needed by a couple of tests, `ghcilink003` and `ghcilink006`).

For building the documentation (User's Guide):

{{{
   sudo apt-get install dblatex docbook-xsl docbook-utils
}}}

other packages that are useful for development:

{{{
   sudo apt-get install linux-tools
}}}

(includes `perf`, see [wiki:Debugging/LowLevelProfiling/Perf])
