= Setting Up a FreeBSD System for Building GHC =

Building GHC on FreeBSD is currently supported on {{{8.4-RELEASE}}} or later, on {{{i386}}} (x86) and {{{amd64}}} (x86_64) architectures.  One might be able to build GHC on different architectures and earlier versions but they are not maintained actively.  Note that {{{8.4-RELEASE}}} is used for the FreeBSD nightly builds ([http://haskell.inf.elte.hu/builders/freebsd-amd64-head/ amd64 head], [http://haskell.inf.elte.hu/builders/freebsd-i386-head/ i386 head]).

'''Note that this section is primarily intended for developers and early adopters.'''  ''If you are just want to install GHC on your system, simply use the [http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-haskell-platform devel/hs-haskell-platform] port instead.  This port does all the things described below for you.  It is usually kept updated to match the latest Haskell Platform specifications.''

== Required Ports ==

In order to be able to build GHC from source, the following ports have to be installed.

 * [http://www.freshports.org/converters/libiconv/ converters/libiconv] (GNU libiconv, versions before 10.0 only)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/autoconf devel/autoconf] (GNU Autoconf)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/automake devel/automake] (GNU Automake)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/git devel/git] (for getting and managing the GHC sources)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/gmake devel/gmake] (GNU Make)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-alex devel/hs-alex] (alex)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-happy devel/hs-happy] (happy)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/ftp/curl ftp/curl] (HTTP support for git)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/lang/ghc lang/ghc] (bootstrap compiler, usually tracking Haskell Platform specifications)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.16] (Perl)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/lang/python27 lang/python27] (Python, for the test suite)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/math/gmp math/gmp] (GNU GMP)

Probably it is possible to use a [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_6_3#freebsd vanilla binary distribution] to bootstrap the build, but one must note that it is built on {{{8.4-RELEASE}}}, hence it will require installing [http://www.freshports.org/misc/compat8x misc/compat8x] in order to make it work on 9.x and later systems.

== Optional Ports ==

In addition to the required ones, there are some further ports to install for extras.

 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/binutils devel/binutils] (for a more up-to-date version of the GNU toolchain, see Notes)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/libffi devel/libffi] (for dynamic linking)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/llvm devel/llvm] (for LLVM code generation)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-haskell-platform devel/hs-haskell-platform] (the complete Haskell Platform)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-hasktags devel/hs-hasktags] (for generating HTAGS files)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/ncurses devel/ncurses] (for a more up-to-date version for the `terminfo` library, see Notes)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/lang/gcc lang/gcc] (for GCC 4.6 or later, see Notes)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/print/dvipsk-tetex print/dvipsk-tetex] (for PDF documentation)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/print/hs-hscolour print/hs-hscolour] (for !HsColourized Haddock documentation)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/textproc/dblatex textproc/dblatex] (for PDF documentation)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/textproc/docbook-xsl textproc/docbook-xsl] (for XML documentation)
 * [http://www.freshports.org/textproc/libxslt textproc/libxslt] (for XML documentation)

== Running `configure` ==

FreeBSD stores locally installed third-party software (i.e. the ports mentioned above) under a separate prefix, called `LOCALBASE` here, which is `/usr/local/` by default.  Thus the preferred way of invoking the `configure` script is as follows.

{{{
$ ./configure \
  --with-gmp-includes=$LOCALBASE/include   --with-gmp-libraries=$LOCALBASE/lib \
  --disable-large-address-space
}}}

The `--disable-large-address-space` disables the runtime's two-step allocator, which isn't currently supported on FreeBSD prior to 11.1 and GHC earlier than 8.6 (see #12695).
On systems earlier than {{{10.0-RELEASE}}}, one has to configure {{{iconv(3)}}} as well.  For {{{10.0-RELEASE}}} and later, {{{iconv(3)}}} functions are part of the base system libraries, so these flags is not needed any more.

{{{
  --with-iconv-includes=$LOCALBASE/include --with-iconv-libraries=$LOCALBASE/lib \
}}}

To use a more recent GCC (this is `gcc46` here) and GNU toolchain from the Ports Collection, it should be added as well:

{{{
  --with-gcc=$LOCALBASE/bin/gcc46 --with-gcc-4.2=$LOCALBASE/bin/gcc46 \
  --with-ld=$LOCALBASE/bin/ld
}}}

Note that one may also want to set the `CC` environment variable to `gcc46` before running {{{configure}}}.

To use `libffi` from the Ports Collection:

{{{
  --with-system-libffi \
  --with-ffi-includes=$LOCALBASE/include --with-ffi-libraries=$LOCALBASE/lib
}}}

== Building the Sources ==

After `configure` ran successfully, invoke GNU make as usual.  Note that GNU make is called `gmake` under FreeBSD as `make` is the BSD make.

{{{
$ gmake -j `sysctl -n hw.ncpu`
}}}

== Notes ==

Here is a random list of thoughts about things that are good to know when working on FreeBSD.

 - The Alex and Happy ports may not be up-to-date enough for building GHC (as they are tracking the versions specified in the Haskell Platform).  Install {{{cabal-install}}} and install those tools using {{{cabal}}} instead.

 - The FreeBSD base system contains GCC and the GNU toolchain in older (pre-10.0) versions.  GCC is technically stuck at version 4.2.1 which may not be optimal for building GHC these days.  Hence it is highly recommended to use the GNU toolchain ([http://www.freshports.org/devel/binutils devel/binutils]) and GCC ([http://www.freshports.org/lang/gcc lang/gcc]) from the Ports Collection instead.

 - Clang is the default base system compiler for FreeBSD 10.0 or later.  So one may try to build GHC using Clang on such systems (however, Clang can also be installed on earlier versions from the [http://www.freshports.org/lang/clang33 lang/clang33] port).  It should work, but have not yet been extensively tested.

 - The FreeBSD base system is shipped with a version of `ncurses` but this may not be the latest.  Unfortunately, when [http://www.freshports.org/devel/ncurses devel/ncurses] is installed one should add some extra lines to `mk/build.mk` to tell GNU make we want to use `ncurses` from `$LOCALBASE` (see above) instead, otherwise `terminfo` (which uses `ncurses`) becomes linked to `ncurses` in the base:

 {{{
SRC_HC_OPTS += -I$LOCALBASE/include -L$LOCALBASE/lib
libraries/terminfo_CONFIGURE_OPTS += --configure-option=--with-curses-includes=$LOCALBASE/include --configure-option=--with-curses-libraries=$LOCALBASE/lib
}}}

 See #7472 for possible symptoms.

 - The GHC source code have an in-tree version of `libffi` and `gmp` which may work by accident -- especially if the version of `libgmp.so` and `libffi.so` matches the version installed by the ports.  But using them is not recommended as they could result in various strange build and run-time errors.  See the `configure` options to work around them.

 - In an extremely high-speed environment it might happen that `gmake` restarts multiple times, c.f. #7592.  This is because timestamp precision for the VFS layer is set to a POSIX-friendly value by default. Adjusting the `vfs.timestamp_precision` sysctl(3) variable can help.

 - Building GHC sources and Haskell sources in general could be sped up by setting up a [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tmpfs&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9.1-stable&arch=default&format=html tmpfs(5)] partition.  (This is not created by the default install.)  Just replace the `/tmp` partition with a tmpfs-backed entry in `/etc/fstab`:

 {{{
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,mode=777 0 0
}}}

 and use your original `/tmp` partition as a swap device (substitute `ada0s1` with your device):

 {{{
/dev/ada0s1d none swap sw 0 0
}}}
