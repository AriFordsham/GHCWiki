= Building GHC on Windows =

This page documents the instructions for setting up a Windows build using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/ MSYS2], which is a fairly complete build of MinGW + the MSYS2 tools.

This guide should get you running in ~5 minutes, modulo download speeds.

== msys2 setup ==

Download and run the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/latest/download msys2 installer (64-bit)] (a [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/i686/ 32-bit version] is also available). Open a mingw64 shell.

'''IMPORTANT:''' the msys2 installer creates multiple shortcuts, "MSYS2 Shell", "MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell" and "MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell". You need the latter one (or the middle one for 32-bit). The MSYS2 shell is set up for building applications with Cygwin which provides an additional POSIX compatibility layer, while MinGW is set up for building native Windows applications which is what we need for GHC. 

An easy way to check that you are running the right shell is to check the output of `echo $PATH`. The first item of the list should be `/mingw64/bin`. Also, `echo $MSYSTEM` should show either `MINGW32` or `MINGW64`.

If you are using a preexisting msys2 installation, consider upgrading all installed packages to the latest versions. That takes a few steps, see [http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/ MSYS2 installation instructions] (section III).

== Installing packages & tools ==

The msys2 package uses `pacman` (the venerable !ArchLinux package manager) to manage packages. Let's install system dependencies required for building GHC:

{{{
pacman -Sy git tar binutils autoconf make libtool automake p7zip mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-gcc
}}}

(Problems with PGP keys? Try `pacman-key --init && pacman-key --populate msys2`)

{{{#!rbox question
Why can't we use CygWin/MSYS2's packaged Python interpreter? It seems to work just fine...
}}}
If you want to run tests, you will need to install a Windows version of [https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/ Python 2]. Python is only used by the test runner and is not necessary for building GHC.

== Host GHC setup ==

A host GHC binary is required for bootstrapping. Let's download and install a prebuilt GHC into `/usr/local`:

{{{
curl http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/7.8.3/ghc-7.8.3-$(uname -m | sed -e s/686/386/)-unknown-mingw32.tar.xz | tar -xJ -C /tmp &&
mkdir -p /usr/local &&
mv /tmp/ghc-7.8.3/* /usr/local &&
rmdir /tmp/ghc-7.8.3
}}}

== Cabal setup ==

Building ghc requires [http://www.haskell.org/alex/ Alex] and [http://www.haskell.org/happy/ Happy]. It is easiest to install them using cabal. We will also put them in `/usr/local` to make sure that they end up on $PATH.

{{{
curl http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-1.20.0.3/cabal-1.20.0.3-i386-unknown-mingw32.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin &&
cabal update &&
cabal install -j --prefix=/usr/local alex happy
}}}

(Note: the 'alex' build appears to be broken on the 32-bit platform, see #9712.)

== A Quick Build ==

You should now be able to build GHC:

{{{
cd ~ &&
git clone --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git &&
cd ghc &&
git clone git://git.haskell.org/ghc-tarballs.git ghc-tarballs
}}}

Consider setting up `mk/build.mk` here (`cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk && vim mk/build.mk`).

Finally, to perform the actual build:

{{{
./boot &&
./configure &&
make -j5
}}}

Msys2 is known to be glitchy in some situations. If you see errors related to fork(), try closing and reopening the shell; see also [http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/tickets/74/ msys2 issue #74]. Also there have been issues with the build process segfaulting. The reason is not known (we're looking into it). If that happens, simply rerunning `make` will continue the build process.

Alternatively, to run a pristine build and tests (takes a while):
{{{
./validate
}}}
