= Building GHC on Windows =

This page documents the instructions for setting up a Windows build using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/ MSYS2], which is a fairly complete build of [http://mingw-w64.org/ MinGW-w64] + the MSYS2 tools.

This guide should get you running in ~5 minutes, modulo download speeds.

== MSYS2 setup ==

=== 64-bit ===

Download and run the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/latest/download 64-bit MSYS2 installer]. Be sure to open a mingw64 shell (see below).

=== 32-bit ===

Download and run the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/i686/ 32-bit MSYS2 installer]. Be sure to open a mingw32 shell (see below).

The result of attempting to create a 32-bit build on a 64-bit machine has not been documented yet. Building on a 32-bit version of Windows works, of course.


=== Configuring MinGW properly ===

'''IMPORTANT:''' The MSYS2 installer creates multiple shortcuts, "MSYS2 Shell", "MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell" and "MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell". You do '''not''' want the "MSYS2 Shell." The MSYS2 shell is set up for building applications with Cygwin which provides an additional POSIX compatibility layer, while MinGW is set up for building native Windows applications which is what we need for GHC. 

An easy way to check that you are running the right shell is to check the output of `echo $MSYSTEM`. It should show either `MINGW32` or `MINGW64`. You can also tell by examining the `$PATH`.

See [http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/ MSYS2 installation instructions] (section III) for details.

== Installing packages & tools ==

The msys2 package uses `pacman` (the venerable !ArchLinux package manager) to manage packages. Let's install system dependencies required for building GHC:

{{{
pacman --sync --sysupgrade --needed --refresh git tar binutils autoconf make libtool automake python2 p7zip patch gcc mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-python2-sphinx
}}}

The `--sync` (abbreviated as `-S`) indicates that you wish to install the given packages. `--sysupgrade` (short form `-u`) indicates that you want to upgrade existing packages. `--refresh` (short form `-y`) indicates that the local package indexes should be updated.

If this `pacman` process fails (as it sometimes does) you can simply re-run it as it ought to be idempotent.

== Host GHC setup ==

A host GHC binary is required for bootstrapping. In order to keep different architectures separate, download and install a prebuilt GHC into `/mingw64` or `/mingw32`:

So for 64-bit you'd run
{{{
curl -L http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/7.8.4/ghc-7.8.4-x86_64-unknown-mingw32.tar.xz | tar -xJ -C /mingw64 --strip-components=1
}}}

and for 32-bit you'd run
{{{
curl -L http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/7.8.4/ghc-7.8.4-i386-unknown-mingw32.tar.xz | tar -xJ -C /mingw32 --strip-components=1
}}}

Note: `--strip-components=1` places everything within the archive's "ghc-7.8.4" folder directly into the target directory.

== Cabal setup ==

Building GHC requires [http://www.haskell.org/alex/ Alex] and [http://www.haskell.org/happy/ Happy]. It is easiest to install them using cabal. We will also put them in `/usr/local` to make sure that they end up on `$PATH`.

{{{
curl -L https://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-1.22.0.0/cabal-1.22.0.0-i386-unknown-mingw32.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin && # for some version of cabal you may need to rename the exe to cabal.exe
cabal update &&
cabal install -j --prefix=/usr/local alex happy
}}}

== A Quick Build ==

You should now be able to build GHC:

{{{
cd ~ &&
git clone --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git &&
cd ghc
}}}

Consider setting up `mk/build.mk` here (`cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk && vim mk/build.mk`).

Finally, to perform the actual build:

{{{
./boot &&
./configure --enable-tarballs-autodownload &&
make
}}}

,,Running parallel make (e.g., make -j5) is faster, but appears to cause segfaults during the build sometimes. The reasons are not clear yet.,,

MSYS2 is known to be glitchy in some situations. If you see errors related to fork(), try closing and reopening the shell; see also [http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/tickets/74/ msys2 issue #74]. Also there have been issues with the build process segfaulting. The reason is not known (we're looking into it). If that happens, simply rerunning `make` will continue the build process.

Alternatively, to run a pristine build and tests (takes a while):
{{{
./validate
}}}

'''NOTE''': You may see an error like `make 7628 child_info_fork::abort: ... make: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable` when running `make`. To fix this, go to the root of your MSYS dir and run `autorebase.bat`; see http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Extension/rebase/rebase-4.0.1_1-1/ and again http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/tickets/74/. Alternatively, run `shutdown //r`.

'''NOTE''': If the build seems super slow (takes more than 1 hour to complete), check your virus scanner and whitelist C:/msys64.
