= Setting Up a OpenBSD System for Building GHC =
note: this is for building on OpenBSD Current as of 2017-04-05\\
note: The wxallow setting will reduce your security (From OpenBSD's point of view)

== Prerequisite ==
* The wxallowed mount option must be specified for the filesystem where the build will take place, and optionally /tmp \\
You can either set it by editing the {{{/etc/fstab}}} like so: 
{{{
01020304050607.h /usr/local ffs rw,nodev,wxallowed 1 2 
}}}
and rebooting, or you can temporary set a mount as wxallowed by running this command: {{{mount -uo wxallowed /usr/local}}}. (where /usr/local is the partition you'd like to affected, run {{{mount}}} to see them all)
See [https://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade60.html] for a more detailed explanation.
* The login class for the user you will be performed the build as needs to have a sufficiently large 'datasize' (datasize-cur: 4096M has been known to work)\\

== Required Tools ==
Install the [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Preparation/Tools required tools]:

{{{
doas pkg_add ghc gmake autoconf%2.69 automake%1.15 gmp libiconv alex happy git
}}}

to also (optionally) build the docs
{{{
doas pkg_add py-sphinx
}}}

== Some required environment variables ==
{{{
export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15
}}}
Optionally (if your /tmp does not have the wxallowed mount option (don't forget to mkdir $HOME/tmp))
{{{
export TMP=$HOME/tmp
export TEMP=$HOME/tmp
}}}

== Get the Sources ==
see [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources Getting the sources]

== Building ==
{{{
./boot
./configure --with-iconv-libraries=/usr/local/lib \
--with-iconv-includes=/usr/local/include \
--with-gmp-libraries=/usr/local/lib \
--with-gmp-includes=/usr/local/include \
--with-ffi-libraries=/usr/local/lib \
--with-ffi-includes=/usr/local/include \
--with-system-libffi
gmake
}}}
