== Haddock documentation ==

The GHC build includes Haddock, and the Haddock documentation for libraries is built and installed by default.

You can disable Haddock documentation for your build by adding
{{{
HADDOCK_DOCS = NO
}}}
to your `mk/build.mk`.

It is also possible to process the libraries sources using [http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hscolour HsColour], and for the Haddock documentation to include links to the !HsColoured source code; in order to do this, just install `HsColour` and re-run `./configure`.  The configure script will tell you whether it found `HsColour` at the end.

To build the Haddock docs for a given library, do this:
{{{
cd libraries/base
make html
}}}

== !DocBook documentation ==

The rest of the documentation, in particular the Users' Guide and Cabal documentation, are in [http://www.docbook.org/ DocBook] XML format.  In order to process the documentation into HTML or printable formats, you need appropriate tools installed.  The `configure` script searches for the appropriate tools, and will tell you whether it found any.

To install the tools necessary for building the documentation, see [wiki:Building/Preparation].

The following make variables control the building of each type of documentation:

{{{
BUILD_DOCBOOK_HTML = YES/NO
BUILD_DOCBOOK_PS   = YES/NO
BUILD_DOCBOOK_PDF  = YES/NO
}}}

They are set to `YES` or `NO` in `mk/config.mk` by configure, depending on whether the necessary tools were detected on your system.  You can override the automatic settings in your `mk/build.mk` file.

== Installing documentation ==

Documentation is installed by default by 'make install'.
