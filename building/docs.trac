== Haddock documentation ==

The GHC build includes Haddock, and the Haddock documentation for libraries is built and installed by default.

You can disable Haddock documentation for your build by adding
{{{
HADDOCK_DOCS = NO
}}}
to your `mk/build.mk`.

It is also possible to process the libraries sources using [http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hscolour HsColour], and for the Haddock documentation to include links to the !HsColoured source code; in order to do this, just install `HsColour` and re-run `./configure`.  The configure script will tell you whether it found `HsColour` at the end.

To build the Haddock docs for a given library, do this:
{{{
cd libraries/base
make html
}}}

== User's Guide ==

In order to process the documentation into HTML or printable formats, you need appropriate tools installed.  The `configure` script searches for the appropriate tools, and will tell you whether it found any.

To install the tools necessary for building the documentation, see [wiki:Building/Preparation].

The following make variables control the building of each type of documentation:

{{{
BUILD_SPHINX_HTML = YES/NO
BUILD_SPHINX_PS   = YES/NO
BUILD_SPHINX_PDF  = YES/NO
}}}

Note: for GHC <= 7.10, use:
{{{
BUILD_DOCBOOK_HTML = YES/NO
BUILD_DOCBOOK_PS   = YES/NO
BUILD_DOCBOOK_PDF  = YES/NO
}}}


They are set to `YES` or `NO` in `mk/config.mk` by configure, depending on whether the necessary tools were detected on your system.  You can override the automatic settings in your `mk/build.mk` file.

To build a document on its own, for example the Users Guide, do this:

{{{
cd docs/users_guide
make html
}}}

substitute 'html' for 'pdf' or 'ps' to build other types of documentation. Note that this will still build the whole compiler if you have not already built it as some pages
of the documentation are automatically generated. 

After building you can find the html users' guide in `docs/users_guide/build-html`.

== Installing documentation ==

Documentation is installed by default by 'make install'.

== Diagnostics ==

If you see an error like this `make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'html'.  Stop.`:
* Documentation targets are most likely disabled in one of the build config files
* Use `make show VALUE=BUILD_SPHINX_HTML` to check if the target is enabled.

=== Target disabled by configuration ===

Check for the values of documentation build variables (e.g. BUILD_SPHINX_HTML) in:
* `mk/flavours/<flavour>.mk`. Most custom build flavors disable documentation targets.
* `mk/config.mk` (`configure` may have disabled the doc build in `config.mk` because required tools were not detected)

=== Target disabled because tools not available ===

* If `sphinx-build` tool is not installed on your machine the HTML docs will be disabled in `config.mk`
* If `xelatex` is not installed on your machine PDF docs will be disabled in `config.mk`
* If you install these tools later do not forget to run `configure` again
