== Haddock documentation ==

The GHC build includes Haddock, and the Haddock documentation for libraries is built and installed by default.

You can disable Haddock documentation for your build by adding
{{{
HADDOCK_DOCS = NO
}}}
to your `mk/build.mk`.

It is also possible to process the libraries sources using [http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hscolour HsColour], and for the Haddock documentation to include links to the !HsColoured source code; in order to do this, just install `HsColour` and re-run `./configure`.  The configure script will tell you whether it found `HsColour` at the end.

To build ''just'' the Haddock docs for a given library, do this:
{{{
cd libraries/base
make html stage=0 FAST=YES
}}}

== !DocBook documentation ==

The rest of the documentation, in particular the Users' Guide and Cabal documentation, are in [http://www.docbook.org/ DocBook] XML format.  In order to process the documentation into HTML or printable formats, you need appropriate tools installed.  The `configure` script searches for the appropriate tools, and will tell you whether it found any.

To install the tools necessary for building the documentation, see [wiki:Building/Preparation].

At the moment, we are not able to build documentation in PDF format due to tool flakiness.  If you manage to find a way to process the documentation into readable PDF, please let us know!

To build a document on its own, for example the Users Guide, do this:

{{{
cd docs/users_guide
make html stage=0 FAST=YES
}}}

substitute 'html' for 'pdf' or 'ps' to build other types of documentation.

== Installing documentation ==

Documentation is installed by default by 'make install'.
