== Haddock documentation ==

The GHC build includes Haddock, and the Haddock documentation for libraries is built and installed by default.  It is also possible to process the libraries sources using [http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hscolour HsColour], and for the Haddock documentation to include links to the !HsColoured source code; in order to do this, just install `HsColour` and run `./configure`.  The configure script will tell you whether it found `HsColour` at the end.


== !DocBook documentation ==

The rest of the documentation, in particular the Users' Guide and Cabal documentation, are in [http://www.docbook.org/ DocBook] XML format.  In order to process the documentation into HTML or printable formats, you need appropriate tools installed.  The `configure` script searches for the appropriate tools, and will tell you whether it found any.

To install the tools necessary for building the documentation, see [wiki:Building/Prerequisites].

At the moment, we are not able to build documentation in PDF format due to tool flakiness.  If you manage to find a way to process the documentation into readable PDF, please let us know!
