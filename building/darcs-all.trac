= darcs-all: operations over all GHC repositories at once =

A GHC tree consists of [wiki:DarcsRepositories multiple repositories]. The `darcs-all` Perl script lets you operate over them all at once.

The basic interface to `darcs-all` is described in comments at the top of the [http://darcs.haskell.org/darcs-all source file].

'''Warning for Windows users''': see #3899. The bottom line is: make sure that `$(TOP)/_darcs/prefs/defaultrepos` has an HTTP url like `http://darcs/haskell.org/ghc`, not a SSH address like `darcs.haskell.org:/home/darcs/ghc`.

== Pulling new patches ==

If you have an existing tree, here is how to pull new patches into all repositories.
{{{
  $ ./darcs-all pull
  $ ./darcs-all get
}}}

The second step is required in the event that new packages or repositories have been added to GHC.

See [wiki:Building/Rebuilding] for how to update your build after pulling patches.

You can also pull patches from another tree:

{{{
  $ ./darcs-all -r /another/ghc pull
}}}

where `/another/ghc` is a path to another local GHC repository.  You can specify a remote repository here too, e.g. `-r http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc-6.10` (remember to omit the final "ghc" when using a remote repo).

The `darcs-all` command is useful for finding out what patches you have relative to another repository:

{{{
  $ ./darcs-all -r /another/ghc push --dry-run
}}}

this tells you which patches there are in your local repository tree relative to the tree over in `/another/ghc`.
