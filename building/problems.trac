 '''Problem'''::
  {{{
  Distribution/Compat/FilePath.hs:2: error: Cabal/Distribution/Compat/FilePath.hs: No such file or directory
  make[1]: *** [depend] Error 1
  make: *** [stage1] Error 1
  }}}
 '''Possible Solution'''::
  Be sure you have run {{{sh darcs-all get}}} to get all necessary packages. Don't forget to run {{{autoreconf}}} again after you pull in new packages.
