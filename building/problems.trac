=== GCC 4 issues ===

It has been observed on Gentoo systems that GCC 4 may fail, complaining about there being no {{{-nopie}}} option. You can either use GCC 3, re-emerge ghc or just edit your {{{/usr/bin/ghc}}} script to remove the {{{-nopie}}} flag (the latter is by far the quickest and is perfectly safe).

== Building from the Darcs tree ==

 '''Problem'''::
  {{{
  Distribution/Compat/FilePath.hs:2: error: Cabal/Distribution/Compat/FilePath.hs: No such file or directory
  make[1]: *** [depend] Error 1
  make: *** [stage1] Error 1
  }}}
 '''Possible Solution'''::
  Be sure you have run {{{sh darcs-all get}}} to get all necessary packages. Don't forget to run {{{autoreconf}}} again after you pull in new packages.
