= GHC Test framework =

GHC includes a comprehensive testsuite for catching any regressions.

The testsuite relies primarily on '''GNU Make''' and '''Python'''. Any version >= 2.5.2 will do although avoid Python 2.6.1 as the testsuite tickles a bug in one of the included libraries.

If you just want to run the whole testsuite, then in the root of the GHC tree, typing:
{{{
$ make test
}}}
will do a run in "fast" mode (which gives an idea whether there are major problems), or
{{{
$ make fulltest
}}}
will do a full testsuite run (more thorough, but takes a lot longer). You should expect that there are no test case failures for the "fast" mode as that is a quality level that all GHC developers are expected to maintain when they check in code. There will usually be some test case failures for the full testsuite run though.
