= GHC Test framework =

NOTE: you need Python (any version >= 1.5 will probably do) in order
to use the testsuite.

To run the test suite against stage 1 of a GHC build in the same
source tree:
{{{
        cd tests/ghc-regress
        make
}}}
(from now on, we'll assume that you're in the tests/ghc-regress
directory).

To run a fast version of the testsuite, which should complete in under
5 minutes on a fast machine with an optimised GHC build:
{{{
        make fast
}}}
To run the testsuite with the stage2 compiler (this is often what you
want, because GHCi tests will fail with stage1):
{{{
        make stage=2
}}}
To run the test suite against a different GHC, say ghc-5.04:
{{{
        make TEST_HC=ghc-5.04
}}}
To run an individual test or tests (eg. tc054):
{{{
        make TEST=tc054
}}}
(you can also go straight to the directory containing the test and say
'make TEST=tc054' from there, which will save some time).

To run the tests one particular way only (eg. GHCi):
{{{
        make WAY=ghci
}}}
