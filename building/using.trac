'''NOTE''': this page now describes the new GHC build system, due to
be added to GHC in April 2009.  For documentation of the "old" build
system, see [wiki:Building/Old/Using].

= Using the Build System =
    
This part of the guide is about ''using'' the build system, that is,
how to interact with the build system when you're developing some part
of GHC, its libraries or tools.  The section aims to be comprehensive;
for a quick start, read [wiki:Building/Hacking] first.

== Source trees and build trees ==

Sometimes we want to separate the build tree from the source tree.
There are a few advantages to doing this:

 * You can make multiple different builds from the same sources,
   perhaps for testing different build settings, or for building
   on different platforms.

 * You might want to put the source tree on a remote, backed-up,
   filesystem, but keep your build tree on a local fast unbacked-up
   drive (this is a configuration we use regularly at GHC HQ).  It
   doesn't matter if you lose the build tree: it can easily be
   regenerated.

 * It's easy to blow away a build tree and start again, without
   modifying your source tree.  `make maintainer-clean` is usually
   good for this too, but it can miss files that it doesn't know
   about, or files that are remnants from older versions of GHC.

 * It helps to avoid mistakes whereby you edit a file that happens
   to be automatically generated, instead of the original source
   file (e.g. editing `config.mk` instead of `config.mk.in`).  If
   you only edit files in the source tree, then this can't happen.

However, if you just want to build the software once on a single
platform, then your source tree can also be your build tree, and you
can skip the rest of this section.

'''Windows users''': so far as we know, symbolic links do not work right on MSYS at least, so we never use separate source and build trees on Windows.

A ''build tree'' is just an exact copy of the source tree, except that
every file in it is a symbolic link to the appropriate file in the
source tree.  There are "standard" Unix utilities that make such
copies, so standard that they go by different names: {{{lndir}}} and
{{{mkshadowdir}}} are two (If you don't have either, the GHC source
tree contains sources for the X11 {{{lndir}}} check out
{{{utils/lndir}}}).

You need to be a bit careful, though, that any new files you create
(if you do any development work) are in the source tree, not the build
tree!

== Booting, configuring, cleaning ==

GHC uses the `autoconf` tools in the standard Unixy way, described in more detail in subsequent subsections on this page:

== Steps to prepare for building ==

We gave a quick getting-started introduction to building GHC in
[wiki:Building/QuickStart], the following sections describe each step
in more detail.

In the build system, the path to the top of your build tree is
referred to as `$(TOP)`, and we will use that convention in the
following sections.

=== Generate configure scripts ===

NOTE: if you're starting from a source distribution that you
downloaded from the GHC web site, rather than darcs sources, you can
skip this step.  Source distributions come with configure scripts
pre-generated for you.

Change directory to `$(TOP)` and issue the command
{{{
$ sh boot
}}}

(Note: the `$` is the prompt.  You don't type that bit.)  This runs
`autoreconf` on the various `configure.ac` scripts in the GHC build
tree, generating `configure` scripts and other miscellaneous files.

You have to re-do this step if (and only if) you ever change one of
the files that `autoconf` uses to generate the `configure` scripts,
such as `configure.ac`, or `aclocal.m4`.

=== Run the configure script ===

Run the `configure` script, thus:
{{{
$ ./configure <args>
}}}

`configure`'s mission is to scurry round your computer working out
what architecture it has, what operating system, whether it has the
`vfork` system call, where `tar` is kept, whether `gcc` is
available, where various obscure `#include` files are, whether
it's a leap year, and what the systems manager had for lunch.  It
communicates these snippets of information in two ways:

 * It translates various files such as `mk/config.mk.in` to
   `mk/config.mk`, substituting for things between "`@`"
   brackets.  So, "`@HaveGcc@`" will be replaced by "`YES`" or
   "`NO`" depending on what `configure` finds.
   `mk/config.mk` is included by every Makefile (directly or
   indirectly), so the configuration information is thereby
   communicated to all Makefiles.

 * It translates `mk/config.h.in` to `mk/config.h`.  The
   latter is `#include`d by various C source files, which can
   thereby make use of configuration information.

`configure` takes some optional arguments.  Use `./configure --help`
to get a list of the available arguments.  Here are some of
the ones you might need:

 `--build=<platform>`::
  Specifies the "build platform" (see [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/PlatformNames platform names]).
  This is usually only necessary on Windows, where you should set it
  to `--build=i386-unknown-mingw32`.

 `--host=<platform>`::
  Set the "host platform" (see [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/PlatformNames platform names]).
  Usually not necessary.

 `--target=<platform>`::
  Set the "target platform" (see [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/PlatformNames platform names]).
  Usually not necessary.

 `--with-ghc=<path>`::
  Specifies the path to an installed GHC which you would like to use.
  This compiler will be used for compiling GHC-specific code (eg. GHC
  itself).  This option ''cannot'' be specified using `build.mk`
  (see later), because `configure` needs to auto-detect the
  version of GHC you're using.  The default is to look for a compiler
  named `ghc` in your path.

 `--with-gcc=<path>`::
  Specifies the path to the installed GCC. This compiler will be used
  to compile all C files, ''except'' any generated by the installed
  Haskell compiler, which will have its own idea of which C compiler
  (if any) to use.  The default is to use `gcc`.  On Windows, this
  should be set to the gcc that comes with MinGW, which by default
  is `c:/mingw/bin/gcc`.

 `--with-ld=<path>`::
  Specifies which `ld` program to use.  Normally only necessary on
  Windows, where you should set it to the `ld` that comes with MinGW,
  which is usually `c:/mingw/bin/ld`.

 `--prefix`::
  Tells the build system where you would like GHC to be eventually
  installed.  You don't have to install GHC in order to use it: it is
  entirely possible to work on GHC and test it without ever modifying
  anything outside the build tree.  However, if you do with to install
  GHC, then the `--prefix` directory is the root of the install tree.
  Typciallly on Unix systems the default for `--prefix` is
  `/usr/local`.  See also [wiki:Building/Installing] for more details.

=== Build configuration ===

Next, you say how this build of GHC is to differ from the standard
defaults by creating a new file `mk/build.mk` ''in the build tree''.
This file is the one and only file you edit in the build tree,
precisely because it says how this build differs from the source.
(Just in case your build tree does die, you might want to keep a
private directory of `build.mk` files, and use a symbolic link in each
build tree to point to the appropriate one.)

`mk/build.mk` is purely for overriding settings that are found in
`mk/config.mk`.  You should never edit `mk/config.mk` directly, since
it is automatically generated from `mk/config.mk.in` by `configure`.
Neither should you edit `mk/config.mk.in`; just provide your settings
in `mk/build.mk`.

We provide a sample file, `mk/build.mk.sample`, which you can copy to
`mk/build.mk` and edit.  It provides a number of pre-defined
configurations, such as a "fast build" or a "development build".  Take
a look in the file itself for details.

To understand more about what you can put in `mk/build.mk`, read on.

==== Common build.mk options ====

The following are some common variables that you might want to set in
your `mk/build.mk`.  For other variables that you can override,
take a look in [[GhcFile(mk/config.mk.in)]].

 `SRC_HC_OPTS`::
  (default: `-H32m -O`)[[br]]
   Options passed to GHC for all Haskell compilations.

 `GhcHcOpts`::
  (default: `-Rghc-timing`)[[br]]
  Options added when compiling GHC (all
  [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/Stages stages])

 `GhcStage1HcOpts`::
  (default: ''empty'')[[br]]
  Options added when compiling the stage 1 GHC.

 `GhcStage2HcOpts`::
  (default: `-O2`)[[br]]
  Options added when compiling the stage 2 GHC.

 `GhcStage3HcOpts`::
  (default: `-O2`)[[br]]
  Options added when compiling the stage 3 GHC.

 `GhcLibHcOpts`::
  (default: `-O2 -XGenerics`)[[br]]
  Options added when compiling the libraries.

 `GhcProfiled`::
  (default: `NO`)[[br]]
  Set to `YES` to enable profiling for GHC itself (stage 2).

 `GhcDebugged`::
  (default: `NO`)[[br]]
  Set to `YES` to pass `-debug` when building GHC (stage 2).

 `GhcLibWays`::
  (default: `p`)[[br]]
  Ways in which to build the libraries.  Must contain
  at least `v` ([wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/VanillaWay the vanilla way]).  Also contains `p` by default (profiling).  For other
  ways, see `mk/config.mk.in`.

 `SplitObjs`::
  (default: `YES` if supported, `NO` otherwise)[[br]]
  When set to `YES`, static library object files are split into smaller
  pieces.  This means that less of the library code needs to be linked
  into the final application, which makes smaller binaries.  It takes
  longer to build libraries this way, though.

 `BUILD_DOCBOOK_HTML`::
 `BUILD_DOCBOOK_PS`::
 `BUILD_DOCBOOK_PDF`::
  (default: `YES` if supported, `NO` otherwise)[[br]]
  When set to `YES`, these build the docbook documentation (e.g. the
  users guide) as HTML, PS and PDF respectively.
  

==== How to make GHC build quickly ====

The GHC build tree is set up so that, by default, it builds a compiler
ready for installing and using.  That means full optimisation, and the
build can take a ''long'' time.  If you unpack your source tree and
right away say {{{./configure; make}}}, expect to have to wait a while.
For hacking, you want the build to be quick - quick to build in the
first place, and quick to rebuild after making changes.  Tuning your
build setup can make the difference between several hours to build
GHC, and less than an hour.  

Here are the `build.mk` settings that we use to build fast:

{{{
# My build settings for hacking on stage 2
SRC_HC_OPTS     = -H32m -O -fasm -Rghc-timing
GhcStage1HcOpts = -O -fasm
GhcStage2HcOpts = -O0 -DDEBUG -Wall
GhcLibHcOpts    = -O -fasm -XGenerics
GhcLibWays      =
SplitObjs       = NO
GhcBootLibs     = YES
}}}

What do these options do?

 {{{SRC_HC_OPTS = -H32m -O -fasm -Rghc-timing}}}::
  These options are added to the command line for all Haskell
  compilations.  We turn on `-fasm`, because that halves compilation
  time at the expense of a few percent performance. `-Rghc-timing`
  prints out a line of timing info about each compilation.  It's handy
  to keep an eye on.  `-Wall` turns on all the warnings; GHC is
  meant to be warning-clean with `-Wall`.

 {{{GhcStage1HcOpts = -O -fasm}}}::
  Build stage 1 optimised: we're going to be rebuilding stage 2 a lot,
  so we want the compiler that does the building to be fast.

 {{{GhcStage2HcOpts = -O0 -DDEBUG -Wall}}}::
  We turn off optimisation here, assuming you'll be modifying and
  testing stage 2.  With optimisation off, rebuilding GHC after
  modifying it will be ''much'' quicker, not only because the
  individual compilations will be quicker, but also there will be
  fewer dependencies between modules, so much less stuff is recompiled
  after each modification.
  [[br]][[br]]
  Also we turn on {{{-DDEBUG}}}, because that enables assertions and
  debugging code in the compiler itself.  Turning on DEBUG makes
  the compiler about 30% slower.

 {{{GhcLibHcOpts = -O -fasm -XGenerics}}}::
  You almost certainly want optimisation ''on'' when building
  libraries, otherwise the code you build with this compiler
  goes really slowly.  {{{-fgenerics}}} add generics support to the
  libraries - you can turn this off if you like (it'll make the
  libraries a bit smaller), but you won't be able to use Generics in
  the code you build against these libraries.

 {{{GhcLibWays =}}}::
  Normally the profiled libraries are built.  Setting {{{GhcLibWays}}} to
  empty disables this, so you only build the normal libs.

 {{{SplitObjs = NO}}}::
  Object splitting causes each module to be split into smaller
  pieces in the final library, to reduce executable sizes when
  linking against the library.  It can be quite time and
  memory-consuming, so turn it off when you're hacking.

 {{{GhcBootLibs = YES}}}::
  If you're just interested in working on GHC, then you probably don't want
  to build the "extralibs" libraries that we normally ship with GHC.  
  So when [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources getting the sources], 
  run `darcs-all` without the `--extra` option.  Alternatively, even if you have
  the libraries in your tree, you can stop them being built by setting
  `GhcBootLibs` in your `build.mk`.

== Building things ==

At this point you have made yourself a fully-configured build tree, so
you are ready to start building real things.

The first thing you need to know is that ''you must use GNU
`make`''.  On some systems (eg. FreeBSD) this is called
`gmake`, whereas on others it is the standard `make` command.
In this document we will always refer to it as `make`; please
substitute with `gmake` if your system requires it.  If you use a
the wrong `make` you will get all sorts of error messages (but no
damage) because the GHC `Makefiles` use GNU `make`'s
facilities extensively.

To just build the whole thing, `cd` to the top of your build tree and
type `make`.  This will prepare the tree and build the various parts
in the correct order, resulting in a complete build of GHC that can
even be used directly from the tree (as `inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`),
without being installed first.

=== Order of the build ===

Here is a high level view of what happens when you build GHC:

 * First, we build a few packages that GHC itself depends on, such as
   `Cabal`, and `filepath`, using your installed GHC.  These packages
   are under `libraries`, and each is built in a subdirectory
   `dist-boot`; for example the bootstrap build of Cabal will be in
   `libraries/Cabal/dist-boot`.

 * Then we build GHC against these packages, still using your
   installed GHC.  This is called the "stage 1" compiler (see
   [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/Stages stages]).  You can run the
   stage 1 compiler by invoking `inplace/bin/ghc-stage1`.  The stage 1
   build of GHC happens in `compiler/stage1`.

 * The stage 1 compiler is now used to build all the packages in the
   `libraries` subdirectory, and the runtime system in `rts`.

 * Finally, the stage 1 compiler is used to build GHC itself again,
   this time against the libraries we just built.  This GHC is called
   stage 2, and can be invokes as `inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`.

There's an optional final stage, using the stage 2 compiler to build a
stage 3 compiler, but this isn't strictly necessary, and is only used
to check that the stage 2 compiler is working properly.


=== What to do after `make` has finished ===

If `make` completes successfully, then it should have created
`inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`, which is a GHC binary you can run directly.
It supports all the usual features, including GHCi if you pass the
`--interactive` flag.  

In fact, the `inplace` directory looks a lot like an installed copy of
GHC (see [wiki:Building/Installing]): there is a `bin`
subdirectory containing various programs that can be run, including
`ghc-pkg`, Haddock and `hsc2hs`.

You can now run the testsuite, see [wiki:Building/RunningTests].
 
You can now install GHC, by typing `make install`.

=== What to do if you get a build failure ===

GHC is a complex system, with many platform-dependent components.  We
try our best to make sure it builds out of the box as often as
possible, but build failures are not uncommon.  If you get some kind
of failure, don't panic.

The chances are, someone else already encountered the same problem as
you and has reported it on a mailing list or as a ticket.  Search for
the error message using your favourite search engine, and if that
doesn't turn anything up then search directly on this Trac.  Finally,
if you don't find a solution:

 * Ask someone: [wiki:MailingListsAndIRC]
 * or just [wiki:ReportABug]



== Developing in a GHC build tree ==

This section describes how to make changes to the sources of GHC, or
its libraries and tools, and use the build system to build and test
those changes.

=== Bringing the whole tree up to date ===

The easy way to bring the tree up to date after making some changes is
simply to go to the top of the tree and say `make`.  The build system
has enough dependencies encoded into it that this should rebuild
everything that needs to be rebuilt, in the correct order.  The
downside is that it will build everything right though to the stage2
compiler and including all the documentation, which might be overkill
if all you wanted to do was to test a small change to GHC.

=== Rebuilding the GHC binary after making changes ===

Suppose you want to make a small change to GHC itself and test it.
Assuming that your tree is already up to date, the best way to do this
is as follows:

{{{
$ cd ghc
$ make stage=2
}}}

This will bring the stage 2 compiler up to date only.  Setting `stage=2` has the effect of disabling all the
rules that build the stage 1 compiler, so the build system will ignore the fact that the stage 1 compiler is also out of date, and hence all the libraries are also potentially out of date.  If you did `make`
from the top-level, all of these dependencies would be taken into
account, and a lot of rebuilding would probably ensue.  There's another target
that takes an even quicker shortcut:

{{{
$ cd ghc
$ make 2
}}}

This is like `make stage=2`, except that it omits the dependency-building phase.  If you have changed the imports in any modules, those new dependencies will not be taken into account by the build system, so you might get a build failure.  On the other hand, this shortcut usually works and the few seconds it saves can make GHC development a much more interactive experience.  There are also `make 1` and `make 3` targets to make the stage 1 and stage 3 compilers respectively.  These targets work in both the `ghc` and `compiler` subdirectories.

=== Building a single sub-component ===

Each subdirectory of the source tree has a
[wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/StubMakefiles stub makefile],
most of which follow this pattern:

{{{
dir = libraries/base
TOP = ../..
include $(TOP)/mk/sub-makefile.mk
}}}

the main purpose of the stub makefile is to invoke `make` at the
top-level of the tree: GHC's build system is
[wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/NonRecursiveMake non-recursive], so
in effect there is really just one `Makefile`, at the top level.
However, the stub makefile has another purpose: it passes a target to
the top-level `Makefile`, telling it to build just the components of
the system in this directory.  For example, when you say `make` in the
`rts` directory, this is actually equivalent to

{{{
$ make -C .. all_rts
}}}

where "`-C ..`" tells make to invoke the `Makefile` in the directory "`..`", and `all_rts` is the target that makes everything in the `rts` subdirectory.
Equivalently, `make all_libraries/base` at the top level would build
everything in the `libraries/base` subdirectory.  To understand how
the `all` targets are defined, see
[wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/StandardTargets standard targets].

You can also clean a single component of the tree, just by saying
`make clean` in a subdirectory.  Again this is equivalent to issuing a
command at the top of the tree of the form `make clean_libraries/base`.

=== Building a single file ===

It's possible to tell make to build a single file, from any subdirectory in the tree.  For example, suppose I want to build just the module `Control.Monad` in the `base` package, I can do it like this:

{{{
$ make libraries/base/dist-install/build/Control/Monad.o
}}}

(you have to know that `dist-install` is the distdir for a package, and object files are put in the subdirectory `build`).  It's also possible to do this from the `libraries/base` subdirectory:

{{{
$ cd libraries/base
$ make dist-install/build/Control/Monad.o
}}}

suppose you wanted to build this module with a few extra flags, perhaps because you want to see what GHC's optimiser is doing on this module:

{{{
$ rm dist-install/build/Control/Monad.o
$ make dist-install/build/Control/Monad.o EXTRA_HC_OPTS=-dcore-lint
}}}

you could also cut-and-paste the command-line to add flags, but sometimes the `EXTRA_HC_OPTS` method is more convenient.

== Installing extra packages ==

The [wiki:Commentary/Libraries boot libraries] are built as part of building GHC; they are built with the stage1 compiler, and imported when the stage2 compiler is compiled with stage1.

All other libraries are stand-alone Cabal packages, and the build system knows nothing about them.  Nevertheless, it is common to want to install extra packages for the GHC in your build tree.  Here's how to do it.

The easiest way is to just use [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall cabal-install]:

{{{
$ cabal install --with-ghc=$(TOP)/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2 <package>
}}}

where `$(TOP)` stands for the root directory of your build tree, and `<package>` is the name of the package you want to install.  This will install the package in your home directory (e.g. somewhere under `~/.cabal/lib` on a Unix system) , so you'll probably want to remove it by hand when you've finished.

There's also a way to build and register a package with GHC but without actually installing it in your home directory.  For example, if you want to install a package from its darcs repository:
{{{
$ cd $(TOP)/libraries
$ darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/parallel
}}}
(You don't have to download the package to `$(TOP)/libraries`; it can go anywhere.)  Now build it using Cabal, telling Cabal to use the GHC from your build tree:
{{{
$ runhaskell Setup configure --with-ghc=$(TOP)/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2
$ runhaskell Setup build
$ runhaskell Setup register --inplace

The `--inplace` flag to `register` tells Cabal not to copy the compiled package, but rather to leave it right where it is, and register this location in the package database in your GHC build tree.

== Standard Targets ==

The following targets work both at the top level, and in any subdirectory of the tree.  When used in a subdirectory, they apply only to the components of the system in that directory.

 `help`::
  Invoking `make help` in any directory of the build tree will elicit
  a message describing the targets available in that directory.

 `all`::
  (default target, can be omitted).  Builds all the targets for this
  directory.  At the top level, builds everything that needs to
  be built for a GHC installation, including the stage 2 GHC, all
  libraries and documentation.  After `make`, `make install` will not
  need to do any further rebuilding.

 `clean`::
  Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
  created by `make`.  Don't delete the files that record the
  configuration.

 `html`, `pdf`, `ps`::
  Build documentation below the current directory (if any) in HTML, PDF, or Postscript format respectively.

To see how these targets are defined: [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/StandardTargets].

The following targets are accepted only by the top-level `Makefile`:

 `install`::
  installs the things built by `all`.  Where does it install them?  In
  the places you specified when running `configure`, principally set
  by the `--prefix` flag; see [wiki:Building/Installing].

 `distclean`::
  The same as `clean`, but also removes files created by `configure`.
  `distclean` preserves files that would normally go in a source
  distrubtion.  Note that after `make distclean` you will have to run
  `./configure` before building again.

 `maintainer-clean`::
  The same as `distclean`, but also removes files generated by `sh boot`.
  The result of `make maintainer-clean` should be a completely clean
  source tree, containing only revision-controlled files.

 `binary-dist`::
  Builds a binary distribution.  A binary distribution is a copy of
  the build tree with the source files removed, such that it can be
  installed on a different system simply by issuing `./configure; make
  install`.

 `sdist`::
  Builds a source distribution.  A source distribution is a source
  tree for GHC, complete with some extra files included for
  convenience so that the user doesn't need to install `autoconf`,
  `Happy`, or `Alex` in order to build it.  Hence `make sdist` only
  works in a completely built tree.
