A note to editors. I (thomie) came up with the following structure:
* Building/GettingTheSources: for initial cloning instructions only
* WorkingConventions/Git (this page): for HELPING developers use git effectively with ghc. This includes how to make build trees with lndir (although it doesn't use git, it's very much related).
* WorkingConventions/FixingBugs: for the RULES that we want contributors to follow for submitting patches. That includes git commit naming conventions.

By moving some git stuff to the FixingBugs page, we end up with a single checklist for patch contributions, which is easier to refer to.

= Getting the GHC sources =

There are two ways to get sources to GHC: download a source distribution, or clone the [http://git-scm.com/ git] repositories.

== Source distributions ==

A source distribution is a file like {{{ghc-7.8.3-src.tar.xz}}}, which contains a complete snapshot of the source tree for a particular version of GHC. Source distributions for all versions of GHC are available from the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/ download page].

Source distributions are easier to build, because we also include the output from running certain external tools like [http://haskell.org/happy Happy], so you don't need to install these tools.

== Git ==
{{{#!comment
1.7.8 is the first release where submodule/.git is a file instead of directory. Might or might not be important when using git new-workdir below.  
}}}
GHC uses â€‹Git for revision control (version 1.7.8 or newer recommended).

[wiki:Repositories] gives a list of all the git repositories used by GHC.   A source tree consists of more than one repository: at the top level there is the main GHC repository, and certain subdirectories contain separate git repositories.


=== Cloning HEAD ===

A complete GHC source tree can be obtained (located in `ghc`) by running the following command:

{{{#!sh
git clone --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git
}}}


**PLEASE READ THIS:** There are some specific Git workflows which will make GHC development a lot more pleasant; read [wiki:WorkingConventions/Git how to use git with GHC] and [wiki:WorkingConventions/FixingBugs how to contribute a patch to GHC] for suggestions about this.

Notes:

 - `git.haskell.org` is reachable via IPv6 as well as IPv4.

 - If you're behind a **firewall blocking port 9418** (or `git clone git://...` fails for some other reason), try replacing `git://` by `http://` or `https://` in the instructions above.

 - The above directions are valid for cloning GHC 7.9 or newer. For cloning GHC 7.8 or earlier, see the [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources/Legacy legacy] instructions.

=== Getting a branch ===

The above instructions will get the HEAD, the main trunk of GHC development. There is also a branch for each stable release line, as well as branches for development of major new features. The active branches are listed on [wiki:ActiveBranches].

To get a branch, you need to get from a repo that contains the branch; in particular, local clones of the central repo will normally not include the branches that are in the central repo.

You can clone a specific branch via:

{{{#!sh
git clone -b <branchname> --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git ghc-<branchname>
}}}

and switch between branches on an existing clone by

{{{#!sh
git checkout <other-branchname>
git submodule update --init
}}}

'''Note:''' The instructions above apply to branches that contain the commit [db19c665ec5055c2193b2174519866045aeff09a/ghc] which converted all sub-repos into submodules. To clone a branch prior to that commit, follow the [Building/GettingTheSources/Legacy legacy] instructions instead. It is best not to attempt to cross that commit with `git checkout`; instead make a fresh clone of the desired branch directly.


=== Getting a tag ===

Starting with GHC 7.10.1, you can simply clone a specific tag via:

{{{#!sh
git clone -b ghc-7.10.1-release --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git ghc-7.10.1
}}}

For 7.8 or earlier, follow the [Building/GettingTheSources/Legacy legacy] instructions.


=== Cloning from !GitHub ===
{{{#!comment
The url `wiki:Building/GettingTheSources/CloningfromGitHub` is mentioned in `./boot`.
Please don't update it willy-nilly.
}}}
The official mirror for GHC on GitHub is located at [https://github.com/ghc/ghc].

First configure the following Git url rewrites to account for the different naming scheme on GitHub (due to GitHub not supporting `/` in repository names) before cloning (those rules are persisted in `${HOME}/.gitconfig` so you need to perform it only once):

{{{#!sh 
git config --global url."git://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf     git://github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."http://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf    http://github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."https://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf   https://github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."ssh://git@github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf ssh://git@github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."git@github.com:ghc/packages-".insteadOf       git@github.com:ghc/packages/ 
}}} 

and then simply proceed by

{{{#!sh
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ghc/ghc
}}}
