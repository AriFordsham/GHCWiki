= Getting the GHC Sources =

There are two ways to get sources to GHC: download a source distribution, or get the sources directly from our repository using [http://git-scm.com/ git].

== Source distributions ==

A source distribution is a file like {{{ghc-7.8.3-src.tar.xz}}}, which contains a complete snapshot of the source tree for a particular version of GHC. Source distributions for all versions of GHC are available from the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download download page].

Source distributions are easier to build, because we also include the output from running certain external tools like [http://haskell.org/happy Happy], so you don't need to install these tools (see below for more).

== Using git: preliminary setup ==

Please make sure that you have the correct name and email address set for Git that you want your commits to be recorded as. Make sure you use the same name and email on all your machines so we can easily track a single author. This can be done in Git by running:

{{{
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
}}}

Then, '''if you are on Windows''', ensure that git handles line-endings sanely by running:

{{{
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
}}}

== Quickly getting the GHC source repository ==

The first thing to do is install [http://git-scm.com/ git]. You'll also need some tools - see [wiki:Building/Preparation] for details.

'''Note:''' The following directions are valid for cloning GHC 7.9 or newer. For cloning GHC 7.8 or earlier, see [#checkout-old-branch below].

On Unix-like systems (Linux, OS X), a complete GHC source tree can be obtained (located in `ghc`) by saying:

{{{
$ git clone --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git
}}}

On Windows, you need to additionally fetch an extra repository containing some build tools. After running `clone`:

{{{
$ cd ghc/
$ git clone git://git.haskell.org/ghc-tarballs.git
}}}

A source tree consists of more than one repository: at the top level there is the main GHC repository, and certain subdirectories contain separate git repositories (for a list see [wiki:Repositories]).

And then read [wiki:WorkingConventions/Git Git Working Conventions] for instructions on how to use Git with GHC development.

{{{#!box note

 - `git.haskell.org` is reachable via IPv6 as well as IPv4.

 - If you're behind a **firewall blocking port 9418** (or `git clone git://...` fails for some other reason), try replacing `git://` by `http://` or `https://` in the instructions above.

 - If you have **push access**, see the [wiki:WorkingConventions/Git#Pushaccess Git Working Conventions - Push Access] for info on setting your push URLs.

== Making a local clone ==

{{{#!box note
TODO: investigate&document `--reference`-based `git clone` which may work better with submodules and doesn't require resetting the origin Repo back to `git.haskell.org`
}}}

You can make a local clone of a GHC tree with

{{{
 $ git clone ~/ghc ~/ghc-branch
}}}

where `~/ghc` is the repository you want to branch and `~/ghc-branch` is where you want to put the branch. Then use `sync-all` (see [wiki:/Building/SyncAll]) to clone the rest of the repositories.  Note that the `origin` for the local clone will point back to the repository that it was cloned from - if you want `origin` to point back to the main GHC repo then do this:

{{{
  $ ./sync-all -r git://git.haskell.org remote set-url origin
}}}

== Making a new workdir ==

I (ezyang) use Git workdirs to manage all of my GHC checkouts. It is quite nice: there is logically only one local repository, and just many checkouts of it, so it's very easy to share patches between various checkouts and your branches are all in one centralized place. However, sharing all of your submodules too takes a bit of work to setup, since Git doesn't natively support this workflow.

Here's what I do:

1. Start by making some pristine GHC checkout (call it `ghc-pristine`) which is an ordinary Git clone of the main GHC repository.

2. Remove all of the submodules that Git recursively created. This is because they are in the wrong format. You can do it with this command: {{{for i in `git submodule status | cut -d' ' -f3`; do rm -rf $i; done}}}

3. Re-checkout the submodules using a normal git clone, rather than the submodule tool. This can be done with this command: {{{for i in `git submodule status | cut -d' ' -f2`; do git clone git://git.haskell.org/`echo "$i" | sed s/libraries/packages/ | sed s/utils\\///`.git $i; done}}} (On OS X you might have to escape the backslash two more times)

4. Finish off the configuration by running {{{git submodule init}}} and {{{git submodule update}}}

Now, to create a new workdir, run `git-new-workdir ghc-pristine ghc-newdir`, and then inside `ghc-newdir`, run {{{for i in `git submodule status | cut -d' ' -f2`; do rmdir $i; git-new-workdir ../ghc-pristine/$i $i; done}}} to recursively make workdirs of all the submodules.

ToDo: Someone should scriptify this.

== Getting a branch (GHC 7.9 or later) ==

The above instructions will get the HEAD, the main trunk of GHC development. There is also a branch for each stable release line, as well as branches for development of major new features. The active branches are listed on [wiki:ActiveBranches].

To get a branch, you need to get from a repo that contains the branch; in particular, local clones of the central repo will normally not include the branches that are in the central repo.

You can clone a specific branch via:

{{{
  $ git clone -b <branchname> --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git ghc-<branchname>
}}}

and switch between branches on an existing clone by

{{{
  $ git checkout <other-branchname>
  $ git submodule update --init
}}}

'''Note:''' The instructions above apply to branches that contain the commit [db19c665ec5055c2193b2174519866045aeff09a/ghc] which converted all sub-repos into submodules. To clone a branch prior to that commit, follow the instructions below instead. It is best not to attempt to cross that commit with `git checkout`; instead make a fresh clone of the desired branch directly.

== Getting a branch (GHC 7.8 or earlier) == #checkout-old-branch

It is best to check out the desired branch directly in a fresh clone, as follows:

{{{
  $ git clone -b ghc-7.8 git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git ghc-7.8
  $ cd ghc-7.8
  $ ./sync-all get -b ghc-7.8
}}}

== Getting a tag ==

{{{#!box note
The commands given below may soon be outdated, starting with GHC 7.10.1, you can simply clone a specific tag via:

`git clone -b ghc-7.10.1-release --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git ghc-7.10.1`
}}}

Each release is tagged in the git repository, making it possible to check out an old version of GHC by tag. To see all available tags, run `git tag` in the GHC repository.

To check out a specific version of GHC, run

{{{

  $ git clone http://git.haskell.org/ghc.git
  $ cd ghc
  $ git checkout <tag>
  $ ./sync-all get
}}}

For checking out a tag after you have already done `./sync-all [OPTIONS] get`

{{{
  $ shopt -s extglob
  $ rm -rf !(.git)
  $ git checkout -f <tag>
  $ ./sync-all get
}}}

== Getting a GHC repository from !GitHub ==

The official mirror for GHC on GitHub is located at [https://github.com/ghc/ghc].

=== New method ===

You don't need `./sync-all` anymore and can use Git commands directly, if you configure the following Git url rewrites to account for the different naming scheme on GitHub (due to GitHub not supporting `/` in repository names) before cloning (those rules are persisted in `${HOME}/.gitconfig` so you need to perform it only once):

{{{#!sh 
git config --global url."git://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf     git://github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."http://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf    http://github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."https://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf   https://github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."ssh://git@github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf ssh://git@github.com/ghc/packages/ 
git config --global url."git@github.com:/ghc/packages-".insteadOf      git@github.com:/ghc/packages/ 
}}} 

and then simply proceed by

{{{#!sh
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ghc/ghc
}}}

=== Old method ===

{{{
  $ git clone git://github.com/ghc/ghc
  $ cd ghc
  $ ./sync-all get
}}}

If you want to clone your own fork instead, add an argument to `sync-all` to tell it where it can find the other repositories it needs.

{{{
  $ git clone <your preferred github.com GHC fork URL> ghc
  $ cd ghc
  $ ./sync-all -r git://github.com/ghc get
}}}

== Tracking the full repository state (pre-March 2014, e.g., the 7.8.* branches) == 
 
'''Since [changeset:db19c665e/ghc], all used repositories are submodules, so this is only relevant to track older states, e.g., for GHC 7.8.*.''' 
 
The full state of a GHC repository includes the current state of the repositories for all of the GHC boot libraries that are used to to build GHC ([wiki:Repositories list of boot libraries]). For GHC 7.8.* the repositories for these libraries are fetched and updated by the `sync-all` script. To record the full repository state (including boot libraries), git submodules can be used starting from March 2014, but for 7.8.* they are not fully usable, so fingerprints are provided instead in annotated & gpg-signed release tags, such as http://git.haskell.org/ghc.git/tag/refs/tags/ghc-7.8.3-release.
That way you're able to restore via the fingerprint for a given release, as in:

{{{
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py restore -f <(git show ghc-7.8.3-release | grep -F '|')
}}} 

Here is how such fingerprints are created. The `fingerprint.py` script in `utils/fingerprint/` can create a "fingerprint" to uniquely identify a GHC repository state by recording the current commits of the GHC and boot library repositories. This fingerprint can be used later to restore the state of all repositories to the state captured by the fingerprint.  
 
To create a new fingerprint, run the `create` command in the top level ghc repo. The fingerprint can also be created from a [wiki:Builder] log that contains the appropriate output from the `sync-all` command by passing the log file to the create command with the `-l` flag. 
 
{{{ 
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py create 
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py create -l builder.log 
}}} 
 
This command will create a new fingerprint, which is just pairs of repositories and commits.  
 
To restore a fingerprint use the `restore` command and pass either a fingerprint file with the `-f` flag or a builder log file with the `-l` flag. 
 
{{{ 
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py restore -f 2011-05-23.fp 
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py restore -l builder.log 
}}} 
 
This command will read the fingerprint and perform a checkout of the appropriate commit for each repository found in the fingerprint. By default, the `restore` command will create a new branch in the top level ghc repository and add an entry to git config that sets the new branch's remote to `origin`. The config options are added so that future `sync-all` commands will work as expected. Passing the `-n` flag will cause the fingerprint script not to create a new branch. To "unrestore" a fingerprint, simply use `sync-all` to checkout the `master` branch in each repository 
 
{{{ 
$ ./sync-all checkout master 
}}} 
 
To make the best use of fingerprinting, you need to collect fingerprints for the states you may wish to restore. To ease the automatic collection of fingerprints, the `fingerprint.py` script allows a `-d DIR` option that will output a fingerprint to the directory `DIR` with the current time stamp as a file name. The `-g DIR` option tells the script to run in the ghc repository pointed to by `DIR`. These options can be useful for collecting fingerprints as a cron job or on a post-commit hook. 
 
To restore the repository state as of a particular date, you can grab a fingerprint emitted by one of the nightly builds.  The nightly build emails are sent to [http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-builds/ the ghc-builds mailing list], and have subjects like "[nightly] 06-Oct-2012 build of HEAD on x86_64-unknown-linux (cam-04-unx)".  Copy and paste the fingerprint section, which looks something like this: 
 
{{{ 
Respository hashes: 
.|4a138b708463a99a1087ce2d8a70239de3aa04e4

}}} 
 
Put it in a file, and run `./utils/fingerprint.py restore -f <file>` to restore your repository tree to that state.
