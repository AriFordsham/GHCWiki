= Getting the GHC Sources =

There are two ways to get sources to GHC: download a source distribution, or get the sources directly from our repository using [http://git-scm.com/ git].

== Source distributions ==

A source distribution is a file like {{{ghc-7.0.4-src.tar.bz2}}}, which contains a complete snapshot of the source tree for a particular version of GHC. Source distributions for all versions of GHC are available from the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html download page].

In addition to fixed releases of GHC, source distributions are also made each night from the current source repository, for both the HEAD and STABLE branches. To download these snapshots, head over to the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html download page].

Source distributions are easier to build, because we also include the output from running certain external tools like [http://haskell.org/happy Happy], so you don't need to install these tools. See [wiki:Building/Preparation] for details.

== Getting a GHC repository using git ==

The first thing to do is install [http://git-scm.com/ git]. And then read [wiki:WorkingConventions/Git Git Working Conventions] for instructions on how to use Git with GHC development.

Please make sure that you have the correct name and email address set for Git that you want your commits to be recorded as. Make sure you use the same name and email on all your machines so we can easily track a single author. This can be done in Git by running:

{{{
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
}}}

Then, if you are on Windows, ensure that git handles line-endings sanely by running:

{{{
git config --global core.autocrlf false
}}}

A source tree consists of more than one repository: at the top level there is the main GHC repository, and certain subdirectories contain [wiki:Repositories separate git repositories]. To get a complete repository tree using git:

{{{
  $ git clone http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc.git/
  $ cd ghc
  $ ./sync-all --testsuite get
}}}

If you have commit access then you will need to also set the push URL:
{{{
  $ ./sync-all -r darcs.haskell.org:/srv/darcs/ remote set-url --push origin
}}}

== Making a local clone ==

You can make a local clone of a GHC tree with

{{{
 $ git clone ~/ghc ~/ghc-branch
}}}

where `~/ghc` is the repository you want to branch and `~/ghc-branch` is where you want to put the branch. Then use `sync-all` as before to branch the rest of the repositories. You can then use `sync-all -r <path>` to push and pull patches between your two local repository trees.

== Getting a branch ==

The above instructions will get the HEAD, the main trunk of GHC development. There are also branches, from which stable releases are made. The active branches are listed on [wiki:Repositories].

To get a branch, you need to get from a repo that contains the branch; in particular, local clones of the central repo will normally not include the branches that are in the central repo.

To get one, run
{{{
  $ git clone -b branch-name http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc.git/
  $ cd ghc
  $ ./sync-all --testsuite get -b branch-name
}}}

== Getting a GHC repository from !GitHub ==

To get GHC repository from [http://www.github.com GitHub] we recommend to just get GHC source code itself from !GitHub and combine this with packages from http://darcs.haskell.org. This is easy since sync-all script supports it well.
{{{
  $ git clone <your preferred github.com GHC fork URL> ghc
  $ cd ghc
  $ ./sync-all -r http://darcs.haskell.org/ get
}}}

If you want a full clone of every package from !GitHub instead, sync-all can handle that as well.
{{{
  $ git clone <your preferred github.com GHC fork URL> ghc
  $ cd ghc
  $ ./sync-all -r git://github.com/ghc get
}}}

The official mirror for GHC on github is located at [https://github.com/ghc/ghc].

== Pulling new patches ==

The [wiki:Building/SyncAll sync-all] script makes it easy to pull new patches. For example, `sync-all pull` will pull all new patches from the original repository into the repository tree in the current directory.

== Tracking the full repository state ==

The full state of a GHC repository includes the current state of the repositories for all of the GHC boot libraries that are used to to build GHC ([wiki:Repositories list of boot libraries]). The repositories for these libraries are fetched and updated by the `sync-all` script. To record the full repository state (including boot libraries), git submodules could be used, but they are not currently in favor (see [wiki:DarcsConversion#Theperspectiveonsubmodules GHC Team perspective on submodules] for some reasons why).

As an alternative to git submodules, the `fingerprint.py` script in `utils/fingerprint/` can create a "fingerprint" to uniquely identify a GHC repository state by recording the current commits of the GHC and boot library repositories. This fingerprint can be used later to restore the state of all repositories to the state captured by the fingerprint. 

To create a new fingerprint, run the `create` command in the top level ghc repo. The fingerprint can also be created from a [wiki:Builder] log that contains the appropriate output from the `sync-all` command by passing the log file to the create command with the `-l` flag.

{{{
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py create
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py create -l builder.log
}}}

This command will create a new fingerprint, which is just pairs of repositories and commits. 

To restore a fingerprint use the `restore` command and pass either a fingerprint file with the `-f` flag or a builder log file with the `-l` flag.

{{{
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py restore -f 2011-05-23.fp
$ ./utils/fingerprint/fingerprint.py restore -l builder.log
}}}

This command will read the fingerprint and perform a checkout of the appropriate commit for each repository found in the fingerprint. By default, the `restore` command will create a new branch in the top level ghc repository and add an entry to git config that sets the new branch's remote to `origin`. The config options are added so that future `sync-all` commands will work as expected. Passing the `-n` flag will cause the fingerprint script not to create a new branch. To "unrestore" a fingerprint, simply use `sync-all` to checkout the `master` branch in each repository

{{{
$ ./sync-all checkout master
}}}

To make the best use of fingerprinting, you need to collect fingerprints for the states you may wish to restore. To ease the automatic collection of fingerprints, the `fingerprint.py` script allows a `-d DIR` option that will output a fingerprint to the directory `DIR` with the current time stamp as a file name. The `-g DIR` option tells the script to run in the ghc repository pointed to by `DIR`. These options can be useful for collecting fingerprints as a cron job or on a post-commit hook.
