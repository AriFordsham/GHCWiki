= Compiling for 32 bits on 64 bits =

This is cross-compilation-light. It doesn't involve building GHC with different host and target, but does involve running 
a GHC with i386 target (and host) on a by-default x86_64 OS. This should be possible on any OS that has multi-arch capabilities,
but the instructions will be only for Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu precise, LTS 12.04.4). Some of the problems are similar
as when really cross-compiling. See #9421 for some more context and common problems.
