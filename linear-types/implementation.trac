On this page we describe the principles behind the implementation of the linear types extension as described at [LinearTypes].

The current implementation progress can be seen on [https://github.com/tweag/ghc/tree/wip/linear-types here]


== Principles

The main principle behind the implementation is to modify `FunTyCon` with an extra argument which indicates the *multiplicity* of an arrow. The data type for multiplicities is defined
in `compilerbasicTypes/Weight.hs` and is called `Rig`. There are two multiplicities, `One` which indicates that the function is linear and `Omega` which indicates that it is not.

The rest of the implementation is essentially correctly propagating and calculating linearity information whenever a `FunTy` is created.
