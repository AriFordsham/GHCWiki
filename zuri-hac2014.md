# Bug squashing at ZuriHac2014


Joachim (nomeata) wants to run a small bugsquashing sprint at [ ZuriHac 2014](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/ZuriHac2014/Projects). Here he collects list of tickets that may be suitable:

- [\#9095](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/9095)

## TODO (by Joachim)

- Collect pointers to important stuff to read.
- Think about where non-developer contributors should put their code (probably github)
- Make sure I have my validate machine up and running efficiently.
