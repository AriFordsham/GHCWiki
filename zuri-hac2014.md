# Bug squashing at ZuriHac2014


Joachim (nomeata) wants to run a small bugsquashing sprint at [ ZuriHac 2014](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/ZuriHac2014/Projects). 

## Requirements


You should bring some Haskell experience and be confident reading other people’s Haskell code. You do not need to know all the latest fancy type hackery – GHC itself is written in quite plain Haskell. Some knowledge of git is also useful.


Obviously, you need a machine to work on. The more core it has, the less you’ll have to wait.

## Setup


If you want to join in, you can come prepared:

- Read through [Newcomers](newcomers)
- Make sure that you have built GHC once yourself.
- Your changes need to be validated. So make sure you validated GHC once. I suggest to have a second working copy of GHC that you only use to validate. There is a [section](working-conventions/git#workflow-with-validate) explaining how to do this.
- Fork [ ghc on github](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/) (or otherwise publish a fork of the GHC repo) for easier collaboration during the hackathon.
- Get an account on this trac.
- Join `#ghc` on freenode.
- (optional, if you plan to stick around) Subscribe to `ghc-dev` and `ghc-tickets` mailing lists.

## Optional tips


If you have a strong remote machine with lots of cores, you can have the validate tree remotely.


For more convenient validation, especially if the validate repository is remotely, I (Joachim) have a script `ci-validate.sh` that waits for a new branch calls `validate/foo`, then validates it cleanly and either moves it to `validated/foo` or `broken/foo`. If you want to set up that as well, fetch the script from my [ ghc-devscripts repository](https://github.com/nomeata/ghc-devscripts).

## Possible tickets


This is a list of tickets that might be suitable for a hacking sprint, but feel free to look for others (click “All Bugs“ and “All Tasks” on the left). And of course, feel free to extend this list.
