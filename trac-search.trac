= Using Search

Trac has built-in search functionality to search for occurrences of keywords and substrings in wiki pages, tickets and changeset properties, such as author, revision and log messages.

Apart from the [search: Search module], you will also find a small search field above the navigation bar at all time. It provides convenient access to the search module from all pages.

The search results show the most recent modifications ranked first rather than the most relevant result.

== Quick searches

For quick access to project resources, the quick-search field at the top of every page can be used to enter a [TracLinks wiki link], which will take you directly to the resource identified by that link:

 * ![42] -- Opens change set 42
 * !#42 -- Opens ticket number 42
 * !{1} -- Opens report 1
 * /trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory in the default repository
 * /repos1/trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory in the `repos1` repository

To disable the Quickjump feature for a keyword start the query with an exclamation mark (`!`): use `!TracGuide` to search for occurrences of the literal word !TracGuide.

== Search TracLinks

From the Wiki, it is possible to link to a specific search, using `search:` links:
 * `search:?q=crash` will search for the string "crash" 
 * `search:?q=trac+link&wiki=on` will search for "trac" and "link" in wiki pages only

== Search Filters

On the search page, pressing the modifier key while selecting a search filter will unselect all other search filters.
