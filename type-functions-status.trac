== Parsing and Renaming ==

Todo:
 1. Complete parsing of associated type synonyms.  (Syntactically type declarations can already occur in classes, but I am not sure whether the AST building routines can already deal with this.) & parse type functions.
 2. Rename associated type synonyms & rename type functions.
 3. Parse and rename equality constraints in signatures.

Done:
 * Parsing and renaming associated data types.

== Type Checking ==

Todo:
 1. Type checking of associated data types.
 2. Type checking of type functions (and hence, associated type synonyms).
 3. Type check functional dependencies as type functions.

Done: 
 * Kind checking for associated data types.

== Desugaring ==

Todo
 1. Desugar associated data types.
 2. Desugar type functions and equality constraints.
 3. Extend interface files.

Done: Nothing.
