= How Should We Spend Friday? =

== Projects ==
Moved most of the "focused" projects to [wiki:HackathonProjects]. 
Add projects ideas there, and add your name if you're interested in working on them.

 * Discussing proposed changes to backend and code generation
 * Discussing dynamic linking
 * Strategies in debugging GHC and RTS.

== General Organization ==
The above are specific projects or subgroups that might form.  What about more generally?  How should we organise the day?

 * just let everyone hack on individual projects, with floating Simons to help. --- I'd like that.
 * form subgroups to work together on shared projects (list moved to [wiki:HackathonProjects])
 * have more explanatory talk sessions led from the front
 * form subgroups for explanatory sessions on different topics (but not to work on a shared project)
 * work on fleshing out the wiki/commentary?
 * ???
