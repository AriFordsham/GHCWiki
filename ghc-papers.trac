== Papers related to GHC ==

Here we've collected together lots of documentation and papers that
generally describe stuff we've implemented in GHC.

All docs are gzipped A4 Postscript unless otherwise specified.

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/threads.ps.gz The Concurrent Haskell Foreign Function Interface].  This document is a draft Haskell addendum that describes GHC's approach to concurrency and its interaction with the FFI and OS threads.

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/core.ps.gz An External Representation for the GHC Core Language].  This document describes the syntax of GHC Core (.hcr) files, which can be used to feed GHC intermediate code to other (non-GHC) back-end processors.

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/hep.ps.gz Haskell Execution Platform] design document.  This document describes the design for an integrated compiler/interpreter API for executing Haskell programs, which forms the heart of the combined Hugs/GHC system.

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/run-time-system.ps.gz Run-time System document].  This document (is supposed to) describe the new run-time system in GHC 4.xx.  Be warned that the implementation and this document are evolving in parallel, so they might not be quite in sync.

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/copyright/accept.asp?path=/users/simonpj/papers/spineless-tagless-gmachine.ps.gz#26pub=34  The Spineless Tagless G-Machine].  This paper describes the execution model used by GHC.  It is most relevant to GHC up to version 3.xx---in version 4 we made some changes which are described in the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/run-time-system.ps.gz RTS document].

 * The UsageSP analysis (ghc/compiler/usageSP/) is described in Keith Wansbrough and Simon Peyton Jones, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/kw217/research/phd/usptr-10pt.ps.gz Once Upon a Polymorphic Type], Technical Report TR-1998-19, Department of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, 1998.  Conference version [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/kw217/research/phd/popl99-usage.ps.gz Once Upon a Polymorphic Type], in The Twenty-sixth ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, January 20-22, 1999, San Antonio, Texas.

 *  GHC's typechecker implementation is described in the paper [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/classhask.ps.gz  Type classes in Haskell], CV Hall, K Hammond, SL Peyton Jones, and PL Wadler, European Symposium On Programming, LNCS 788, Springer Verlag, pp.  241-256, April 1994.

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/new-rts.ps.gz The New GHC/Hugs Runtime System]---a summary of the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/run-time-system.ps.gz RTS document].

 * [http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/async.ps.gz Asynchronous Exceptions in Haskell]

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/records.htm Lightweight Extensible Records for Haskell]

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/derive.htm Derivable Type Classes]

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/pat.htm Pattern Guards and Transformational Patterns]

 * [http://www.research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/inlining/index.htm Secrets of the GHC inliner]

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/inc-gc.htm Non-stop Haskell] the workings of an incremental garbage collector (not included in GHC, so far).

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/concurrent-haskell.ps.gz Concurrent Haskell]

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/imprecise-exn-sem.htm Imprecise Exceptions, Co-Inductively]

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/except_ps.gz A semantics for imprecise exceptions]

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/imperative.ps.gz Imperative Functional Programming] 

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/lazy-functional-state-threads.ps.gz Lazy Functional State Threads]

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/unboxed-values.ps.gz Unboxed Values as First-Class Citizens] 

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/profiling.ps.gz Time and Space Profiling for non-strict, higher-order functional programs]

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/grasp-jfit.ps.gz The Glasgow Haskell Compiler - a Technical Overview] - from 1992, not entirely relevant any more.

 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/extendGHC.ps.gz Adding an Optimisation Pass to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler] (Olaf Chitil).  Somewhat out of date.
