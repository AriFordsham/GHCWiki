# Welcome to the GHC Developer Wiki


This is the home for GHC developers. If you're only interested in using GHC,
then you probably want the [ GHC home page](http://www.haskell.org/ghc). If you are an aspiring GHC developer,
and just want to get started, read the [Newcomers page](newcomers) (which is always in the
sidebar under "Joining in").

## Please help improve the GHC developer's wiki


Please help us improve the information on the GHC developer's wiki. You can easily do this by editing the wiki directly. Just [ register](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/register) an account, and then edit away. Alternatively, [ log in](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/login) as user **guest** with password **guest** (but we'd prefer you to create an account, because it enables us to contact you if necessary). The [ Help/Guide](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TracGuide) link at the top of every page gives a good description of the markup language and how to use Trac in general.
