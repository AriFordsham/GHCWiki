# Project suggestions for the 2006 GHC hackathon


Add your suggestions for the hackathon below...

- Hack to allow RTS to integrate with an external event loop (eg to give us ideal threading when using Gtk+)
- Add a `ghc --clean` that just executes `find -name '*.o' -o -name '*.hi' -exec rm {} \;`, perhaps in a more portable fashion
