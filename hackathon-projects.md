# Project suggestions for the 2006 GHC hackathon


Add your suggestions for the hackathon below...

- Hack to allow RTS to integrate with an external event loop (eg to give us ideal threading when using Gtk+)
- Add a `ghc --clean` that just executes `find -name '*.o' -o -name '*.hi' -exec rm {} \;`, perhaps in a more portable fashion
- Further work on debugging in GHCi
- Hack on the ideas in [BackEndNotes](back-end-notes)
- Something packaging or Cabal-related
- Any of the bugs (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: bug, order: priority), tasks (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: task, order: priority, group: difficulty), or feature requests (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: feature+request, order: priority).
