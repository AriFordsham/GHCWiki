# Block Objects: Marshalling Them Explicitly

**TODO**

- Implement the examples from the main page by using the standard Haskell to C FFI.  This provides an outline of the code we want the compiler to generate.
- Evaluate which parts of the code actually need to be generated and which parts could go into an extension of the FFI library (`Foreign.C.Blocks`) or into the RTS if it is C code.
