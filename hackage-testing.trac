= Hackage Testing =

We now have an automated program for performing regression tests against all of hackage.

To check it out, run
{{{
darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/hackage-test/
}}}

'''Caution:''' This program can cause arbitrary code to run on your machine. For example, if any modules use TH, then the TH will be executed. `configure` scripts will be run. Custom `Setup.hs` programs will be run.

== Example of usage ==

Here's a run with the HEAD, no special options:
{{{
$ ht normal ../cabal-install/dist/build/cabal/cabal  \
            /home/ian/ghc/darcs/ghc/inst/bin/ghc     \
            /home/ian/ghc/darcs/ghc/inst/bin/ghc-pkg \
            "" ""
}}}
[7.75 hours pass]

Then another run, this time using `-XAlternativeLayoutRule` to compile
each package (but not the build dependencies of the package):

{{{
$ ht alternative ../cabal-install/dist/build/cabal/cabal  \
                 /home/ian/ghc/darcs/ghc/inst/bin/ghc     \
                 /home/ian/ghc/darcs/ghc/inst/bin/ghc-pkg \
                 ""                                       \
                 "--ghc-option=-XAlternativeLayoutRule"
}}}
[7 hours pass]

And finally a comparison of the results:

{{{
$ htc normal alternative
                            normal
                         Buildable Build failed Deps failed Not tried
alternative Buildable          628            0           0         0
            Build failed        73          215           0         0
            Deps failed          0            0         170         0
            Not tried            0            0           0         0
}}}
i.e. 73 packages became unbuildable when the alternative layout rule was
used.
