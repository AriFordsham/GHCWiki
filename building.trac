This Guide is primarily aimed at those who want to build and/or
hack on GHC.  It describes how to get started with building GHC on your
machine, and how to tweak the settings to get the kind of build you
want.  It also describes the inner workings of the build system, so you
can extend it, modify it, and use it to build your code.
