# Resources for newcomers to GHC


This page is intended to serve as the first stop for those people who say, "I want to contribute to GHC, but I don't know quite where to begin." Begin here. While the [building guide](building), [working conventions](working-conventions), [commentary](commentary) and [debugging](debugging) pages (always linked from the left sidebar) have great information that can come in handy while you're working on your first, or first several patches, this page is intended to have the details you will need to get rolling.

## First steps

- To orient yourself to the general architecture of GHC, [ this article](http://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html), written by two of the chief architects of GHC, Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton-Jones, is excellent and current (2012).

- While you're reading that article, download and build the sources. [Prepare](building/preparation) your machine, [download](building/getting-the-sources) the source, and [build](building/hacking). For the short, short version, which may or may not work for your machine, you can try this:

```
# needed only once, URL rewrite rule is persisted in ${HOME}/.gitconfig
git config --global url."git://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf git://github.com/ghc/packages/ 

# clone GHC's main Git repository (creates './ghc' folder in CWD)
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ghc/ghc
cd ghc/
git clone git://github.com/ghc/ghc-tarballs.git  # Windows only
# configure build
cd mk
cp build.mk.sample build.mk
## edit build.mk to remove the comment marker # on the line "BuildFlavour = quick"
cd ..
perl boot
./configure

# build GHC
make -j8 # parallelize to at most 8 parallel jobs; adapt to actual number of cpu cores
## edit build.mk to remove the comment marker # on the line stage=2
```


replace `git://` by `http://` or `https://` in the instructions above if you're behind a firewall blocking port 9418. For more details see also [Building/GettingTheSources](building/getting-the-sources).

>
> If your machine has all the prerequisites, this might just work. Expect it all to take roughly an hour.

- After a successful build, you should have your brand new compiler in `ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`. (GHCi is launched with `ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2 --interactive`). Try it out.

- To speed up the development cycle, the final edit of `build.mk` makes sure that only the stage-2 compiler will be rebuild after this (see [here](building/architecture/idiom/stages) about stages).

- A good first sanity check is to twiddle some error message in the code, just to see that changed error message pop up when you compile a file. Write some Haskell code with an error in it, and look at the error message. Search through the code for that error message. Change the message, rebuild ghc (run `make` again), and recompile your file again with `ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`. If you see the changed message, you're good to go.

- To further speed up the development cycle, after you make some changes, don't run `make` directly in the ghc root directory (where you ran `make` the first time). Instead run it in the directory where you are making your changes, usually `compiler`, `ghc`, `rts` or one of the `libraries` or `utils` subdirectories. This greatly speeds up a rebuild.

## Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature


Below is a list of tickets that appear to be "low-hanging fruit" -- things that might be reasonable for a newcomer to GHC hacking. Of course, we can't ever be sure of how hard a task is before doing it, so apologies if one of these is too hard.

Once you fix the bug or implement the new feature, make sure to write a test-case proving that you've done what you said. Then take some time to get to know and submit a code review to [Phabricator](phabricator). If the patch looks good, one of the committers will put it into the GHC codebase. Then, tackle another bug!

## Practical advice

- [This page](working-conventions/fixing-bugs) describes in more detail workflow for fixing bugs.

- Learn about our [git working conventions](working-conventions/git) and [git submodules](working-conventions/git/submodules).

- I (Richard E) use emacs to edit the code, and I have a hotkey dedicated to searching the ghc codebase, and another one dedicated to compiling ghc. This makes work on ghc much more interactive. See [the Emacs page](emacs) for more info.

## Less practical advice

- Don't get scared. GHC is a big codebase, but it makes sense when you stare at it long enough!

- Be forewarned that many pages on the GHC wiki are somewhat out-of-date. Always check the last modification date. Email if you're not sure.

## Need help?


You can email the [ ghc-devs](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-devs) list, or Richard Eisenberg (`eir at cis . upenn . edu`), a newish GHC developer himself who would be happy to foster more participation and answer your emails.


Happy hacking!
