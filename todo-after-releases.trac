== Things to do after releases are made ==

* Update default GHC version for new Trac tickets. 

* Update [wiki:Commentary/Libraries/VersionHistory].

* Delete `__GLASGOW_HASKELL__` ifdefs for versions of ghc older than the [Building/Preparation/Tools previous 2 major releases]. But not from the testsuite, since those ifdefs might exist to be able to compile the test w/ older GHCs in order to compare behavior. Something like (add versions which you want to keep the ifdefs for, remove versions you want to delete them for):
{{{#!sh
git grep -l GLASGOW_ | grep -v 'users_guide\|testsuite' | xargs grep GLASGOW_ | grep -v '\712\|711\|710\|709\|708'
}}}
