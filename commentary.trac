= The GHC Commentary =

This tree of wiki pages is a "commentary" on the GHC source code.  It contains all the explanatory material that doesn't belong in comments in the source code itself, because the material is wide-ranging, usually covers multiple source files, and is more architectural in nature.  The commentary can also be considered a design document for GHC.

Please feel free to add material to this commentary: don't worry too much about accuracy, in due course someone will edit your contribution.  Try to link to source files as much as possible by using this macro: {{{[[GhcFile(compiler/Makefile)]]}}} (the usual Trac {{{source:}}} macro doesn't work here because the GHC darcs repository isn't integrated into this Trac).  Also try to add appropriate links to other parts of the commentary.

Please feel free to add new pages here.  In due course information will migrate from here to the main commentary above.

 * The Compiler
   * [wiki:TypeFunctions]: Notes concerning the implementation of type functions and associated types, which was merged in the HEAD during ICFP'06.
   * [wiki:IntermediateTypes]: Notes about the type system of GHC's new intermediate language (in the HEAD since ICFP'06)
   * [wiki:DataParallel]: Notes about the implementation of Data Parallel Haskell
   * [wiki:RewriteRules]: Notes about the implementation of RULEs in GHC
   * [wiki:BackEndNotes]: Some ideas and notes about the back end.
   * [wiki:Commentary/CmmExceptions Cmm: Implementing Exception Handling]: Implementing exception handling for primitive operations in Cmm
   * [wiki:GhciDebugger]: Some notes about the implementation of the GHCi debugger. Probably uninteresting unless you want to work on the debugger.
    * AddingNewPrimitiveOperations: How to add new primitive operations to GHC Haskell.
   * [wiki:ReplacingGMPNotes Replacing GMP]: Notes from an effort to replace GMP with another Bignum library.
   * [wiki:ExternalCore]: Describes the process of bringing External Core up to speed. Once finished, this will simply describe what External Core is, and how it works. 
   * [wiki:HaddockComments]: Some notes about how the Haddock comment support is implemented.
   * [wiki:ExplicitCallStack]: Notes about maintaining an explicit call stack, to support error attribution and profiling.
   * [wiki:Commentary/PositionIndependentCode Position Independent Code and Dynamic Linking]

 * The Runtime System
   * [wiki:GarbageCollectorNotes] Notes about GHC's existing single threaded garbage collector and development of a parallel GC.
   * [wiki:SemiTagging]: Describes how the semi-tagging optimisation will be implemented.
   * [wiki:PAPI]: Measurement of program performance usign CPU events (cache misses, branch mispredictions).

 * Getting to grips with the code base
   * BeginnersNotes: Some notes about getting started hacking GHC and the structure of the compiler (especially types and typecheck)
   * DebuggingGhcCrashes: how to use gdb to debug a crash in GHC-compiled code.

 * [wiki:AboutVideos Hackathon presentations] (video)
 
== Old but useful ==

Finally, here are some generally-useful, but now somewhat-out-of-date resources:
 * [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ghc/comm/ The old GHC Commentary]: Information on the internals of GHC, in various states of up-to-dateness.  We are keen to move this stuff out of its current location and onto this Wiki.  If anyone is willing to help do that, even for just a part in which you are interested, we would be delighted.
 * GhcPapers: papers and pointers to other documents that relate to the inner workings of GHC.
