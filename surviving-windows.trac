There is a veritable zoo of software which is 


== msys2 (the distribution) ==

**msys2** is a software distribution packaging a number of components including,
 * the **msys2 runtime** (see below)
 * the `pacman` package manager
 * a basic UNIX-like command-line environment
 * a toolchain for compiling code written for a POSIX environment (linking against the **msys2 runtime**)
 * 64- and 32-bit `mingw` toolchains

== `msys2` (the runtime) ==

The **msys2 distribution** is built upon the **`msys2` runtime**, which is a fork of the **Cygwin runtime**. The runtime provides basic POSIX APIs, making it possible to run software written to run on a POSIX-like system on Windows.

The msys2 and Cygwin runtimes used to differ strongly, but have been converging (see https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/blob/master/msys2-runtime/PKGBUILD for the current patches). Most of the remaining differences are to make the provided environment a bit closer to Windows than Cygwin's behavior.

== msys2 (the toolchain) ==

The msys2 distribution includes a compiler toolchain which can be used to compile code written for a POSIX environment. It can be found in `/usr/bin` (e.g. `/usr/bin/gcc`).

Executables compiled with this toolchain will link against the **`msys2` runtime**. Consequently this is not the toolchain to use to build GHC. Instead use the **`mingw-w64` toolchain** (see below).

== Cygwin ==

Cygwin is a runtime library providing a POSIX-like environment, allowing software written for POSIX systems to run on Windows unchanged. The `msys2` distribution that we use in GHC doesn't use Cygwin, but instead the `msys2` fork (see above). Cygwin differs from `msys` in that it seeks to provide complete Linux emulation in user-mode; in contrast, `msys2` merely seeks to provide enough POSIX support to be able to use toolchains such as `mingw-w64` to make native binaries.

== `Mingw-w64` ==

`Mingw-w64` is a compiler toolchain based upon `gcc` targeting Windows systems which is packaged with the `msys2` distribution. It started as a fork of the `mingw` toolchain.

== `mingw` == 

`mingw` is a compiler toolchain based upon `gcc` targeting Windows systems. The project is now unmaintained. `mingw` is not used by `msys2` distribution used by GHC; instead it packages the `mingw-w64` toolchain.

== `msvcrt` ==

The Microsoft Visual C runtime. This is the `libc` of the Windows world.
