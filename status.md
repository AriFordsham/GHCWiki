# GHC Status

## Automated builds and performance testing


We have several automated ways of monitoring GHC.  Each has its own detailed description page.

- [Buildbots](builder-summary) build GHC every night on multiple platforms.
- [Travis](travis) watches the repository for new commits (any branch) and validates them.
- [ Our performance dashboard](http://ghcspeed-nomeata.rhcloud.com) (experimental) monitors changes in the performance of GHC itself, and of programs compiled by GHC, with a per-commit granularity.
