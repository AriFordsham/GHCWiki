## Performance


Here are the [ results of the nobench suite](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/nobench/i686/results.html), showing how GHC performs relative to various versions of itself, and other Haskell compilers.

## Planning notes


Here is our [current planning document](ghc-planning), intended mainly to help Simon, Simon, and Ian coordinate with each other.

## Design notes


Here are notes about aspects of GHC's design that are up for discussion.  (They often relate to Haskell generally, rather than just GHC, but it's a convenient place to keep them.)

- [Haskell library organisation](commentary/packages/package-reorg)
- [The design for the package system itself](commentary/packages/ghc-packages-proposal)
- [Support for better error reporting](explicit-call-stack); the "head \[\]" problem.
