== Summary == 
  EventLog framework exists in the GHC RTS to support profiling of GHC run-time events, such as capability states.  A visualizer is currently under development for viewing the profiling information.

== Design ==
  * EventLog framework is located in ghc/rts/eventlog/
  * Library to parse EventLog files for any visualizer, which relies upon the Data.Binary library: GHC/RTS/Events
  * Visualizer: under development

== Feature List ==
  * EventLog framework
    * Support for more events, such as cpu and memory usage (TODO)
  * EventLog parser library
    * Parsing all events supported by EventLog framework (TODO)
  * Visualizer 
    * Capability to Thread view (TODO)
    * Filtering of capabilities and/or threads (TODO)
    * Querying: find sequences of events, use regular expressions to find events (TODO)
    * Overlay multiple graphs to display multiple event types (e.g., a graph with thread states, cpu usage, and memory usage)
    * Gracefully handle when a non-EventLog file is loaded by the visualizer (TODO: robustness needed)
    * Export graphs in multiple formats: pdf, jpg, grayscale, etc. (TODO)
    * Link code to events (TODO: very difficult, may not happen)
