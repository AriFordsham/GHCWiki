== Summary == 

!EventLog is a fast, extensible event logging framework in the GHC run-time system (RTS) to support profiling of GHC run-time events. The [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/runtime-control.html#rts-eventlog GHC User's Guide] describes how to enable event logging, after the program is linked with `eventlog`

{{{
+RTS -l
}}}

Log events in binary format to the file program.eventlog, where flags is a sequence of zero or more characters indicating which kinds of events to log. Currently there is only one type supported: -ls, for scheduler events.

The format of the log file is described by the header EventLogFormat.h that comes with GHC, and it can be parsed in Haskell using the [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-events ghc-events] library. To dump the contents of a .eventlog file as text, use the tool show-ghc-events that comes with the ghc-events package.

== Design ==
  * !EventLog framework is located in ghc_root/rts/eventlog/
  * A [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-events ghc-events] library to parse !EventLog files for any visualizer, which relies upon the Data.Binary library.
  * Visualizer: [http://raintown.org/?page_id=132 ThreadScope]

== Code repository ==
  * Available in GHC 6.10.x in ghc_root/rts/eventlog
  * [http://code.haskell.org/ghc-events ghc-events: EventLog binary file parser for profilers]
  * [http://code.haskell.org/ThreadScope/ ThreadScope: thread-level profiler for GHC EventLog events]
