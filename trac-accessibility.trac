= Accessibility Support in Trac

Not every user has a graphic environment with a mouse or other pointing device. Some users rely on keyboard, alternative keyboard or voice input to navigate links and activate form controls. In a Trac session, users can use devices other than a pointing device by enabling keyboard shortcuts through the [/prefs/keybindings Keyboard Shortcuts] preferences panel.

Trac supports accessibility keys for the most common operations. The access keys differ by browser and the following work for several browsers:
 - on Linux platforms, press any of the keys listed below in combination with the `<Alt>` key
 - on a Mac, use the `<Ctrl>` + `<Opt>` key instead
 - on Windows, you need to hit `<Shift> + <Alt> + <Key>`. This works for the most common browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer
