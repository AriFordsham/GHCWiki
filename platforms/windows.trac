This page is aimed at developers building GHC on the Windows platform (on x86 hardware).  Please add to this page.

= Versions supported =

We no longer support Windows 95, 98, ME or NT. We do support 2000, XP and Vista. We do not support 64-bit windows operating systems (#1884).

= Building GHC on Windows =

First places to look is the Building Guide.  Specifically:
 * [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/platforms.html#cygwin-and-mingw Stuff about Cyginw and MSYS].  GHC builds many, many times faster if you use MSYS than Cygwin.
 * [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Windows Instructions for building under Windows]

== Common problems ==

If you get a message like this:
{{{
Can't locate object method "path" via package "Autom4te::Request" (perhaps you forgot to load "Autom4te::Request"?) at /usr/bin/autom4te line 81.
Can't locate object method "path" via package "Autom4te::Request" (perhaps you forgot to load "Autom4te::Request"?) at /usr/bin/autom4te line 81.
autoreconf: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
}}}
then you have probably not got {{{automake}}} installed (or at least findable).
