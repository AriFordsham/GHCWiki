# Windows Support for GHC

## Versions supported


We no longer support Windows 95, 98, ME or NT. We do support 2000, XP and Vista. We do not support 64-bit windows operating systems ([\#1884](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/1884)).

## Building on Windows


Build instructions for Windows are incorporated in the [Building Guide](building).  In particular, here is how to [set up your Windows system for building GHC](building/prerequisites#preparing-a-windows-system).
