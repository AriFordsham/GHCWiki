# Windows Support for GHC

## Versions supported


We no longer support Windows 95, 98, ME or NT. We do support 2000, XP and Vista.

## Building 32-bit Windows programs


Current releases of GHC provide a 32bit Windows version for building 32bit programs on Windows. It ships with a small [ MinGW](http://mingw.org/) system bundled, which provides tools (such as a C compiler, linker and assembler) that are used by the compiler.

## Building 64-bit Windows programs


Releases of GHC since 7.6.1 also provide a 64bit Windows version for building 64bit programs on Windows. It ships with a [ MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/) system bundled, which provides tools (such as a C compiler, linker and assembler) that are used by the compiler.

## Building on Windows


Build instructions for Windows are incorporated in the [Building Guide](building).  In particular, here is how to [set up your Windows system for building GHC](building/preparation/windows).
