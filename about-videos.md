# Hackathon presentations


At the first GHC Hackathon (Portland 2006), the two Simons gave a number of informal presentations about the internals of GHC.  Since they mostly talked around the wiki material in the Commentary, I have tried to attach the videos to the relevant pages.  Here are some technical details about the video:

- Format: QuickTime movie
- Size: 320x240
- Video Codec: H.264
- Audio Codec: AAC (MPEG-4)
- Frame rate: 15 fps
- Key frames: 75
- Hinted for streaming: yes


Basically, if you have a Mac or Windows (2000 or later) PC with a recent version of iTunes (incorporates QuickTime), then they should stream for you.  You may need to wait for 30 seconds or more before they start to play.  If you don't have iTunes, then you can download just QuickTime for free from Apple:

The quality of the audio or (particularly) video may not be great.  They are intended mostly as a guide to the wiki commentary, so try to make sure you can see the wiki pages side by side with the video, because it may be difficult to make out the visual details otherwise.
