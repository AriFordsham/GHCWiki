== Custom Type Errors

This page outlines the design for a GHC feature to provide support for user-specified type errors.
The main idea was presented by Lennart Augustsson at the 2015 Haskell Symposium in Vancouver BC. 


=== The Problem

When designing EDSLs in Haskell, it is useful to have something like `error` at the type level.
In this way, the EDSL designer may show a type error that is specific to the DSL, rather than the standard GHC type error.

For example, consider a type classes that is not intended to be used with functions, but the EDSL user accidentally used
it at a function type, perhaps because they missed an argument to some function.  Then, instead of getting a the standard
GHC message about a missing instance, it would be nicer to emit a more friendly message specific to the EDSL.

Similarly, the reduction of a type-level function may get stuck due to an error, at which point it would be nice to
report an EDSL specific error, rather than a generic error about an ambiguous type or something.


=== A Solution

One way to solve the above problem is by adding a single uninterpreted type-function as follows:
{{{#!hs
type family TypeError (msg :: ErrorMessage) :: k
}}}

Note that `TypeError` is polymorphic in the kind of result it returns, so it may be used in any context.  In this respect it resembles to polymorphic value `error`.  
The intention is that users will never define instances of `TypeError`, so one may think of it as closed type family with no equations.  In other words, `TypeError`
will never evaluate to anything, and it is basically very similar to the polymorphic type-level value `Any`, which is already present in GHC.

The kind `ErrorMessage` is a small DSL for constructing error messages, and may be defined using a promoted datatype:
{{{#!hs
data {-kind-} ErrorMessage =
    Text Symbol                        -- Show this text as is
  | forall t. ShowType t               -- Pretty print a type
  | ErrorMessage :<>: ErrorMessage     -- Put two chunks of error message next to each other
  | ErrorMessage :$$: ErrorMessage     -- Put two chunks of error message above each other
}}}


=== Examples

Here are some examples of how one might use these:

{{{#!hs
instance TypeError (Text "Cannot 'Show' functions." :$$: 
                    Text "Perhaps there is a missing argument?")
         => Show (a -> b) where
   showsPrec = error "unreachable"
}}}

The resulting error message from GHC is:

{{{
Cannot 'Show' functions.
Perhaps there is a missing argument?
In the expression: show id
In an equation for ‘f’: f = show id
}}}

Similarly, one may use the same sort of technique in type family instances;

{{{
type family F a where
  F Int     = Bool
  F Integer = Bool
  F Char    = Int
  F a       = TypeError (Text "Function F does not work for type " :<>:
                        ShowType a :<>: Text "." :$$:
                        Text "It works only on integers and characters.")
}}}

The resulting error message from GHC is:

{{{
Function F does not work for type [Int].
It works only on integers and characters.
In the expression: undefined
In an equation for ‘f’: f = undefined
}}}


=== Implementation

The implementation in GHC is fairly straight-forward:

   1. When we are reducing a type function, and we notice that the RHS is of the form `TyperError msg :: k`, then
      we stop reducing the type function, and instead we emit a new wanted constraint `TypeError msg :: Constraint`.
      Since there is no way to solve such constraints, this constraint is eventually reported as an error, and will
      be rendered using a custom pretty printer.  (QUESTION:  Should we mark the `TypeError` constraint as unsolvable straight away?).

   2. We add custom pretty printing for unsolved constraints of the form `TypeError msg :: Constraint`.
      The custom pretty printing code examines `msg` and interprets it using the standard pretty printing combinators.

   3. When interpreting `msg` it is useful to evaluate type level functions that we encounter along the way.
      This allows the programmer to use type-level functions to construct the `msg`.  OTOH, the types within
      `ShowType` are printed as is, without evaluating function any more than usual.

   4. `TypeError msg :: k` where `k` is not constraint is printed simply as `(type error)`.  The reason for this
       is that on occasion such types may appear in other parts of the error message and we don't want to print the
       error multiple times, or in its ugly DSL form.

  

=== Alternative Design

It is our intention that `TypeError` will usually in the RHS of a type-level function defintion,
or as the sole participant in the context of a class `instance`.   It is probably not useful to write `TypeError` in
a user-defined signature or a datatype declaration, but it also does not appear to be harmful to do so---at least
not any more harmful than any other partial type-level function.

Instead of using the type function `TypeError`, we could ad special language syntax for error-reporting class instances
and type-family instances.  This seems like a bit heavy-weight, and it is not clear that it buys us much.  Also, we'd
have to think of more syntax and implement it.
