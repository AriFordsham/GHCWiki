== Custom Type Errors

This page outlines the design for a GHC feature to provide support for user-specified type errors.
The main idea was presented by Lennart Augustsson at the 2015 Haskell Symposium in Vancouver BC. 

The relevant ticket is #9637.


=== The Problem

When designing EDSLs in Haskell, it is useful to have something like `error` at the type level.
In this way, the EDSL designer may show a type error that is specific to the DSL, rather than the standard GHC type error.

For example, consider a type classes that is not intended to be used with functions, but the EDSL user accidentally used
it at a function type, perhaps because they missed an argument to some function.  Then, instead of getting a the standard
GHC message about a missing instance, it would be nicer to emit a more friendly message specific to the EDSL.

Similarly, the reduction of a type-level function may get stuck due to an error, at which point it would be nice to
report an EDSL specific error, rather than a generic error about an ambiguous type or something.


=== A Solution

One way to solve the above problem is by adding a single uninterpreted type-function as follows:
{{{#!hs
type family TypeError (msg :: ErrorMessage) :: k
}}}

Note that `TypeError` is polymorphic in the kind of result it returns, so it may be used in any context.  In this respect it resembles to polymorphic value `error`.  
The intention is that users will never define instances of `TypeError`, so one may think of it as closed type family with no equations.  In other words, `TypeError`
will never evaluate to anything, and it is basically very similar to the polymorphic type-level value `Any`, which is already present in GHC.

The kind `ErrorMessage` is a small DSL for constructing error messages, and may be defined using a promoted datatype:
{{{#!hs
data {-kind-} ErrorMessage =
    Text Symbol                        -- Show this text as is
  | forall t. ShowType t               -- Pretty print a type
  | ErrorMessage :<>: ErrorMessage     -- Put two chunks of error message next to each other
  | ErrorMessage :$$: ErrorMessage     -- Put two chunks of error message above each other
}}}


=== Examples

Here are some examples of how one might use these:

{{{#!hs
instance TypeError (Text "Cannot 'Show' functions." :$$: 
                    Text "Perhaps there is a missing argument?")
         => Show (a -> b) where
   showsPrec = error "unreachable"
}}}

The resulting error message from GHC is:

{{{
Cannot 'Show' functions.
Perhaps there is a missing argument?
In the expression: show id
In an equation for ‘f’: f = show id
}}}

Similarly, one may use the same sort of technique in type family instances;

{{{
type family F a where
  F Int     = Bool
  F Integer = Bool
  F Char    = Int
  F a       = TypeError (Text "Function F does not work for type " :<>:
                        ShowType a :<>: Text "." :$$:
                        Text "It works only on integers and characters.")
}}}

The resulting error message from GHC is:

{{{
Function F does not work for type [Int].
It works only on integers and characters.
In the expression: undefined
In an equation for ‘f’: f = undefined
}}}


=== Implementation

The implementation in GHC is fairly straight-forward:

* `TypeError` is a type function.  So the flattener already automatically extracts it from inside any types, into a `CFunEqCan`.  We don't need to hunt for it!

* When we are reducing a type function, and we notice that the RHS is of the form `TyperError msg :: k`, then we stop reducing the type function, and instead we emit a new insoluble wanted constraint `TypeError msg :: Constraint`.  ('''SLPJ''': I hate this.  See SLPJ alternative below.)

* The new insoluble wanted constraint is very like the current `CHoleCan` constraint that we use for type and term wildcards.
  * We mark it as insoluble right away.
  * It is kept in the residual `WantedConstraints` returned by the constraint solver (i.e. we do ''not'' report the error right away).
  * The error is reported later, by `TcErrors.reportUnsolved`.
  * Because of this delay, the ultimate error message will embody the result of all unifications that take place, which makes the error message more informative.

* We add custom pretty printing (in `TcErrors`) for unsolved constraints of the form `TypeError msg :: Constraint`.  The custom pretty printing code examines `msg` and interprets it using the standard pretty printing combinators.

* When interpreting `msg` it is useful to evaluate type level functions that we encounter along the way. This allows the programmer to use type-level functions to construct the `msg`.  OTOH, the types within `ShowType` are printed as is, without evaluating function any more than usual.  '''SLPJ''' Here I'm not sure.  A good deal of evaluation will happen automatically simply through the usual flattening mechanism. Including in the arugment of `ShowType` unless we take measures to stop it. '''Iavor:''' I think it is OK for GHC to evaluate as much as it wants in the printed types.  I added this point because I had to add some extra code to force some additional evaluation in the `msg`, ''outside'' of ShowType.  For example, if the error message is itself computed using a type-level function, we want to make sure that we fully evaluate this function, so that we get to the combinators of the DSL.


* `TypeError msg :: k` where `k` is not constraint is printed simply as `(type error)`.  The reason for this is that on occasion such types may appear in other parts of the error message and we don't want to print the error multiple times, or in its ugly DSL form.

=== SLPJ alternative design ===

* I think the easiest way to both describe and implement the feature is this:
  * `TypeError` is a type function
  * It reduces immediately to `Any` (or possibly to a variant of `Any`, whose name is `(type error)`).
  * When it reduces to `Any`, GHC emits a custom error message

* There are two reasons I suggest that it reduces to `Any`:
  * To avoid emitting the same error message multiple times, as the constraint solver repeatedly re-considers the same `(TypeError m)` function call.
  * Reducing to `Any` (or `(type error)`) automatically means that any types involving `TypeError` will, if displayed, print `Any` (or `(type error)`), not an elaborate call to `TypeError`.

* The "emit a custom error message" bit is implemented as you have it now, by emitting a special insoluble.

This approach would be quite a bit simpler than your current story, where you specially recognise type functions whose RHS is `TypeError`, and also have to suppress calls to `TypeError` that appear embedded in types.

  

=== Alternative Design

It is our intention that `TypeError` will usually in the RHS of a type-level function defintion,
or as the sole participant in the context of a class `instance`.   It is probably not useful to write `TypeError` in
a user-defined signature or a datatype declaration, but it also does not appear to be harmful to do so---at least
not any more harmful than any other partial type-level function.

Instead of using the type function `TypeError`, we could ad special language syntax for error-reporting class instances
and type-family instances.  This seems like a bit heavy-weight, and it is not clear that it buys us much.  Also, we'd
have to think of more syntax and implement it.

== Design questions (RAE) ==

1. What happens with Given `TypeError` constraints? Naively, the `TypeError` constraint on an instance would seem to lead to an "inaccessible code" error. (And this point would be right! It ''is'' inaccessible code.)

2. Relatedly, when definition an instance with a `TypeError` constraint, what should users write in the body? Leaving it empty causes warnings, but anything written in there would never be called.

3. Do we support `foo :: TypeError (Text "") -> TypeError (Text ""); foo = id`? I don't have a strong feeling one way or the other, but it would be nice to have this specified.
