# Data Parallel Haskell


This page documents the integration of nested data parallelism into GHC at the developer level, including notes about where we are and what needs doing.  See also the [ user-level wiki page](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell), which includes examples and tutorial-style instructions.


Most of the material is partitioned into a set of subpages:

- [Other nested data parallel work](data-parallel/related)

## Old material


Pages that have fallen out of use (and contain out dated information):
