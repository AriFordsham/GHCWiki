= Quantified contexts =

This wiki page summarises the state of play on the idea of allowing quantification in class contexts.  For example
{{{
data Rose f a = Branch a (f (Rose f a))

instance (Eq a, forall b. (Eq b) => Eq (f b))
       => Eq (Rose f a)
  where ...
}}}
The new bit is the `forall` in the context of the instance declaration.

Here are some resources

* [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/derivable-type-classes Derivable type classes], Section 7, where the idea was first proposed (I think).

* #2893, a ticket about the idea

* [http://i.cs.hku.hk/~bruno//papers/hs2017.pdf Quantified class constraints], a Haskell 2017 paper that works out the idea in some detail, and a [https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/6me3sv/quantified_class_constraints_pdf/ Reddit thread] about it.
