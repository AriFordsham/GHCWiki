== Code Coverage For GHC Test Suite ==

We bootstrap GHC with the code coverage tool regularly. The
latest copy is always located at http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hpc

This is a possible place to start looking for code that is not currently
tested by our test suite.
