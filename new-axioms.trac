This page describes an extension to type families that supports overlap.

 * See also the ''' [wiki:NewAxioms/DiscussionPage Discussion Page] ''' added May 2012, for comment/suggestions/requests for clarification/alternative solutions, to explore the design space.
 * See also the ''' [wiki:NewAxioms/CoincidentOverlap Coincident Overlap] ''' page (added August 2012) for a discussion around the usefulness of allowing certain overlaps when the right-hand sides coincide.
 * See also the ''' [wiki:NewAxioms/TemplateHaskell Template Haskell] ''' page (added December 2012) for a proposal for the Template Haskell changes necessary to support this change.

Status (Jan 12): the groundwork is done, in HEAD; mainly making `CoAxiom` a more fundamental data type.  Not yet started on the details.

Status (Aug 12): A working prototype implementation is in `overlapping-tyfams`.

Status (Dec 12): A working implementation has been pushed to HEAD.

== Background == 
One might imagine that it would be a simple matter to have a type-level function
{{{
type family Equal a b :: Bool
}}}
so that `(Equal t1 t2)` was `True` if `t1`=`t2` and `False` otherwise.  But it isn't.  

You can't write
{{{
type instance Equal a a = True
type instance Equal a b = False
}}}
because System FC (rightly) prohibits overlapping family instances.  

Expanding this out, you can do it for a fixed collection of types thus:
{{{
type instance Equal Int Int = True
type instance Equal Bool Bool = True
type instance Equal Int Bool = False
type instance Equal Bool Int = False
}}}
but this obviously gets stupid as you add more types.  

Furthermore, this is not what you want. Even if we restrict the equality function to booleans
{{{
type family Equal (a :: Bool) (b :: Bool) :: Bool
}}}
we can't define instances of Equal so that a constraint like this one
{{{
Equal a a ~ True
}}}
is satisfiable---the type instances only reduce if a is known to True or False. GHC doesn't reason by cases.  (Nor should it, |Any| also inhabits |Bool|. No kinds really are closed.)

The only way to work with this sort of reasoning is to use Overlapping Instances, as suggested in the [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/HList/ HList paper.]

== What to do about it ==

A new version of axioms is now implemented. The formal treatment can be found in docs/core-spec/core-spec.pdf.

Here are the changes to source Haskell.

 *  A `type instance` declaration can define multiple equations, not just one:
{{{
type instance where
  Equal a a = True
  Equal a b = False
}}}

 * Patterns within a single `type instance` declaration (henceforth "branches") may overlap, and are matched top to bottom.

 * A single type family may, as now, have multiple `type instance` declarations:
{{{
type family F a :: *

type instance where
  F [Int] = Int
  F [a]   = Bool

type instance where
  F (Int,b) = Char
  F (a,b)   = [Char]
}}}

 * The instances for `F` may not overlap.  That is, there must be no type `t` such that `(F t)` matches more than one instance. This rule explicitly excludes overlaps among group members, even if the right-hand sides coincide (but see the [wiki:NewAxioms/CoincidentOverlap Coincident Overlap] page for discussion).

 * The groups do not need to be exhaustive.   If there is no equation that matches, the call is stuck. (This is exactly as at present.)

 * An error is issued when a later equation is matched by a former, making the later one inaccessible.
{{{
type instance where
  F (a,b)   = [Char]
  F (Int,b) = Char
}}}
  Here the second equation can never match.

For closed kinds (and maybe for open ones, but I can't unravel it), it seems possible to write a set of equations that will catch all possible cases but doesn't match the general case. This situation is currently (Dec 2012) undetected, because I (Richard, `eir` at `cis.upenn.edu`) am unconvinced I have a strong enough handle on the details. For example, what about {{{Any}}}?

 * The equations do not need to share a common pattern:
{{{
type instance where
  F Int = Char
  F (a,b) = Int
}}}

 * When matching a use of a type family against a branched instance, special care must be taken (by GHC) not to accidentally introduce incoherence. Consider the following example:
{{{
type instance where
  F Int = Bool
  F a   = Char
}}}
  and we try to simplify the type {{{F b}}}. The naive implementation would just simplify {{{F b}}} to {{{Char}}}, but this would be wrong. The problem is that {{{b}}} may later be unified with {{{Int}}}, meaning {{{F b}}} should simplify to {{{Bool}}}, not {{{Char}}}. So, the correct behavior is not to simplify {{{F b}}} at all; it is stuck for now. Note that the second equation above is not useless: we will still simplify, say, {{{F Double}}} to {{{Char}}}.
More formally, we only match a type against an equation in an instance group when no previous equation can ''unify'' against the type.

== Limitations ==

The implementation described above does not address all desired use cases. In particular, it does not work with associated types at all. (Using something like {{{type where}}} in a class definition is a parse error.) There's no set reason the approach couldn't be expanded to work with associated types, but it is not done yet. In particular, the FC extension will handle intra-module overlapping associated types without a change. The biggest reason not to add associated types into the mix is that it will be a confusing feature. Overlap among class instances is directed by specificity; overlap among family instances is ordered by the programmer. Users would likely expect the two to coincide, but they don't and can't, as it would not be type safe:

It seems that inter-module overlapping non-coincident associated types are a Bad Idea, but please add comments if you think otherwise and/or need such a feature. Why is it a Bad Idea? Because it would violate type safety: different modules with different visible instances could simplify type family applications to different ground types, perhaps concluding {{{True ~ False}}}, and the world would immediately cease to exist.

This last point doesn't apply to overlapping type class instances because type class instance selection compiles to a term-level thing (a dictionary). Using two different dictionaries for the same constraint in different places may be silly, but it won't end the world.
