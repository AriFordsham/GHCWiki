# A plan for type-indexed type representations


This is Ben Gamari's plan for moving ahead with the type-indexed `Typeable`
scheme, described most recently in
[ A reflection on types](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/haskell-dynamic/).

## `Type.Reflection`


The new type-indexed typeable machinery will be exposed via a new module
(`Type.Reflection` is chosen here, although this name is still up in the air;
`Reflection` in particular has an unfortunate conflict with Edward Kmett's `reflection`
library). The user-visible interface of `Type.Reflection` will look like this,

```
-- The user-facing interfacemoduleType.ReflectionwhereclassTypeable(a :: k)-- This is how we get the representation for a typetypeRep:: forall (a :: k).Typeable a =>TypeRep a 

-- This is merely a record of some metadata about a type constructor.-- One of these is produced for every type defined in a module during its-- compilation.---- This should also carry a fingerprint; to address #7897 this fingerprint-- should hash not only the name of the tycon, but also the structure of its-- data constructorsdataTyContyConPackage::TyCon->StringtyConModule::TyCon->StringtyConName::TyCon->String-- A runtime type representation with O(1) access to a fingerprint.dataTypeRep(a :: k)instanceShow(TypeRep a)-- Since TypeRep is indexed by its type and must be a singleton we can trivially-- provide theseinstanceEq(TypeRep a)where(==)__=TrueinstanceOrd(TypeRep a)where compare __=EQ-- While TypeRep is abstract, we can pattern match against it.-- This can be a bi-directional pattern (using mkTrApp for construction).patternTRApp:: forall k2 (fun :: k2).()=> forall k1 (a :: k1 -> k2)(b :: k1).(fun ~ a b)=>TypeRep a ->TypeRep b ->TypeRep fun

              ->TypeRep fun

-- We can also request the kind of a typetypeRepKind::TypeRep(a :: k)->TypeRep k

-- and compare typeseqTypeRep:: forall k (a :: k)(b :: k).TypeRep a ->TypeRep b ->Maybe(a :~: b)eqTypeRep':: forall k1 k2 (a :: k1)(b :: k2).TypeRep a ->TypeRep b ->Maybe(a :~~: b)-- it can also be useful to quantify over the type such that we can, e.g.,-- index a map on a typedataTypeRepXwhereTypeRepX:: forall a.TypeRep a ->TypeRepX-- these have some useful instancesinstanceEqTypeRepXinstanceOrdTypeRepXinstanceShowTypeRepX-- A `TypeRep a` gives rise to a `Typeable a` instance without loss of-- confluence.withTypeable::TypeRep a ->(Typeable a => b)-> b

TyCon -> [TypeRepX] -> TypeRep a
```

## Preserving compatibility with `Data.Typeable`


Note how above we placed the new type-indexed typeable in an entirely new
module. The goal of this is to preserve compatibility with the old
`Data.Typeable`. Notice how the old `Data.Typeable.TypeRep` is essentially
`TypeRepX` under the new scheme. This gives us a very nice compatibility story,
as noted by Richard Eisenberg,

```
moduleData.Typeable(I.Typeable,moduleData.Typeable)whereimportType.Reflectionas I

-- | A quantified type representation.typeTypeRep=I.TypeRepXtypeOf:: forall a.Typeable a => a ->TypeReptypeOf_=I.typeRepX (Proxy::Proxy a)typeRep:: forall proxy a.Typeable a => proxy a ->TypeReptypeRep=I.typeRepX

cast:: forall a b.(Typeable a,Typeable b)=> a ->Maybe b
cast x
  |JustHRefl<- ta `I.eqTypeRep` tb =Just x
  | otherwise                         =Nothingwhere
    ta =I.typeRep ::I.TypeRep a
    tb =I.typeRep ::I.TypeRep b

eqT:: forall a b.(Typeable a,Typeable b)=>Maybe(a :~: b)eqT|JustHRefl<- ta `I.eqTypeRep` tb =JustRefl| otherwise                         =Nothingwhere
    ta =I.typeRep ::I.TypeRep a
    tb =I.typeRep ::I.TypeRep b

typeRepTyCon::TypeRep->TyCon-- the old typeOfN exports from the pre-PolyKinds days can-- also be trivially provided.
```

## The representation serialization problem


Serialization of type representations is a bit tricky in this new world. Let's
say that we want to serialize (say, using the `binary` package), for instance, a
type-indexed map,

```
dataTMap a
lookup::TypeRepX->TMap a ->Maybe a
insert::TypeRepX-> a ->TMap a ->TMap a

-- we want to support these operations...getTMap::Binary a =>Get(TMap a)putTMap::Binary a =>TMap a ->Put
```


This is the sort of usage we might see in, for instance, the `Shake` build system.

### Serializing `TypeRep`


Of course in order to provide `getTMap` and `putTMap` we need to be able to both
serialize and deserialize `TypeRepX`s. Serialization poses no particular issue.
For instance, we might write,

```
instanceBinaryTyConputTypeRep::TypeRep a ->PutputTypeRep tr@(TRCon tc)=do put 0
                              put tc
                              putTypeRep (typeRepKind tr)putTypeRep(TRApp f x)=do put 1
                              putTypeRep f
                              putTypeRep x

putTypeRepX::TypeRepX->PutputTypeRepX(TypeRepX rep)= putTypeRep rep
```


That was easy.


Now let's try deserialization.

### Deserialization


First, we need to define how deserialization should behave. For instance, defining

```
getTypeRep::Get(TypeRep a)
```


is a non-starter as we have no way to verify that the representation that we
deserialize plausibly represents the type `a` that the user requests.


Instead, let's first consider `TypeRepX` (thanks to Adam Gundry for his guidance),

```
getTypeRepX::GetTypeRepXgetTypeRepX=do
    tag <- get ::GetWord8case tag of0->do con <- get ::GetTyConTypeRepX rep_k <- getTypeRepX
                case rep_k `eqTypeRep`(typeRep ::TypeRepType)ofJustHRefl-> pure $TypeRepX$ mkTrCon con rep_k
                    Nothing-> fail "getTypeRepX: Kind mismatch"1->doTypeRepX f <- getTypeRepX
                TypeRepX x <- getTypeRepX
                case typeRepKind f ofTRFun arg _|JustHRefl<- arg `eqTypeRep` x ->
                      pure $TypeRepX$ mkTrApp f x
                    _-> fail "getTypeRepX: Kind mismatch"_-> fail "getTypeRepX: Invalid TypeRepX"
```


Note how we need to invoke type equality here to ensure,

- in the case of a tycon: that the tycon's kind is `Type` (as all kinds must be in the `TypeInType` scheme)
- in the case of applications `f x`:

  - that the type `f` is indeed an arrow
  - that the type `f` is applied at the type `x` that it expects


Given this we can easily implement `TypeRep a` given a representation of the expected `a`,

```
getTypeRep::Typeable a =>Get(TypeRep a)getTypeRep=doTypeRepX rep <- getTypeRepX
   case rep `eqTypeRep`(typeRep ::TypeRep a)ofJustHRefl-> pure rep
       Nothing-> fail "Binary: Type mismatch"
```

### Through static data?


One might have the idea that the solution here may be to avoid encoding
representations at all: instead use GHC's existing support for static data, e.g.
add `TypeRep a` entries to the static pointer table for every known type. One will quickly realize, however, that
this is unrealistic: we have no way of enumerating the types that must
be considered and even if we did, there would be very many of them.

## Type-indexed `TyCon`s


Under the above proposal `TyCon` is merely a record of static metadata; it has no
type information and consequently the user is quite limited in what they can do with it.
Another point in the design space would be to add a type index to `TyCon`,

```
-- metadata describing a tycondataTyConMeta=TyConMeta{ tyConPackage ::String, tyConModule  ::String, tyConName    ::String}newtypeTyCon(a :: k)=TyConTyConMetapatternTRCon::TyCon a ->TypeRep a

-- which allows us to providemkTyCon::TyCon a ->TypeRep a
```


While this is something that we could do, I have yet to see a compelling reason
why we **should** do it. The only way you can produce a `TyCon` is from a `TypeRep`,
so ultimately you should be able to accomplish everything you can with type-index
`TyCon`s by just not destructuring the `TypeRep` from which it arose.

## `Data.Dynamic`

`Dynamic` is largely unchanged although it would be best to drop the re-export of `Data.Typeable`,

```
moduleData.Dynamicwhere-- Dynamic itself no longer needs to be abstractdataDynamicwhereDynamic::TypeRep a -> a ->Dynamic-- ConstructiontoDynR::TypeRep a -> a ->DynamictoDyn::Typeable a => a ->Dynamic-- EliminationfromDynamicR::TypeRep a ->Dynamic->Maybe a
fromDynamic::Typeable a =>Dynamic->Maybe a

-- fromDynR::TypeRep a ->Dynamic-> a -> a
fromDyn::Typeable a =>Dynamic-> a -> a

-- ApplicationdynApp::Dynamic->Dynamic->Dynamic-- Existing function; calls error on failure-- I think this should be deprecateddynApply::Dynamic->Dynamic->MaybeDynamic
```


Ben Pierce also
[ suggested](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TypeableT#Data.Dynamic) this
variant of `Dynamic`, which models a value of dynamic type "inside" of a known
functor. He p

```
dataSDynamic s whereSDynamic::TypeRep a -> s a ->SDynamic s

toSDynR::TypeRep a -> s a ->SDynamic s
toSDyn::Typeable a => s a ->SDynamic s
fromSDynamicR::TypeRep a ->SDynamic s ->Maybe(s a)fromSDynamic::Typeable a =>SDynamic s ->Maybe(s a)fromSDynR::TypeRep a ->SDynamic s -> s a -> s a
fromSDyn::Typeable a =>SDynamic s -> s a -> s a
```
