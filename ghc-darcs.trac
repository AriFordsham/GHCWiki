== Using the GHC darcs repository ==

There are several darcs repositories related to GHC:

||[http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc]||The main GHC repository||
||[http://darcs.haskell.org/libraries]||The libraries||
||[http://darcs.haskell.org/testsuite]||The test suite||
||[http://darcs.haskell.org/nofib]||The benchmark suite||

Additionally, we have the following branches:

||[http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc.ghc-6.4]||6.4 branch of GHC||
||[http://darcs.haskell.org/libraries.ghc-6.4]||6.4 branch of the libraries||

A source tree consists of the GHC repository, with libraries as a sub-directory:

{{{
  $ darcs get --partial http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc
  $ cd ghc
  $ darcs get --partial http://darcs.haskell.org/libraries
}}}

'''NOTE''': you really want {{{--partial}}}, at least when grabbing GHC.  There are some 13000 patches in the repository, which take a long time to download without {{{--partial}}}.

Optionally, you might want to grab the testsuite and benchmark suite too, which should also be sub-directories of ghc:

{{{
  $ darcs get --partial http://darcs.haskell.org/nofib
  $ darcs get --partial http://darcs.haskell.org/testsuite
}}}

To submit patches to the developers, please use {{{darcs send}}}.
