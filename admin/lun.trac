lun is a vm, running on lambda. It runs the community services.

== VM ==

The config is in `lambda:/etc/libvirt/qemu/community.xml`, and the disk image
`/srv/community/vdisk.img`.

It's controlled by `virsh`, e.g.:
{{{
lambda$ sudo virsh list --all
 Id Name                 State
----------------------------------
  - community            shut off

lambda$ sudo virsh start community
Domain community started

lambda$ sudo virsh list --all
 Id Name                 State
----------------------------------
  2 community            running
}}}

To start it with a console, use:
{{{
lambda$ sudo virsh start community --console
}}}
or to connect to the console if it's already running:
{{{
lambda$ sudo virsh console community
}}}
and `Ctrl+]` to exit the console.

See the `virsh` manpage for more information.

== exim ==

The config is in `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template` with local changes delimited by:
{{{
# start lun local
...
# end lun local
}}}

After changing, run `/usr/sbin/update-exim4.conf` then `/etc/init.d/exim4 reload`.

== apache ==

The various sites are configured in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/*`. Symlinks in
`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/` enable them.

Modules are similarly enabled by symlinks in `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/`.

After changing anything, run `/etc/init.d/apache2 reload`.
