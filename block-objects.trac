= FFI Support for C Block Objects =

Apple recently [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1370.pdf proposed] the inclusion of lambda abstractions (closures) into C/C++/Objective-C and facilitated an implementation in the `clang` compiler framework.  They called this language extension ''blocks'' (or ''block objects'').  It is widely used in the APIs of OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and 10.7 (Lion).  This page is about extending the Haskell 2010 FFI to directly support blocks â€” i.e., to enable Haskell functions to be marshalled as blocks to C and to enable C blocks to be marshalled as Haskell functions to Haskell land.  This extension will be enabled by the language option `BlockObjects`.
