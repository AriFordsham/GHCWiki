Should your name be here? Just edit the page and add yourself 
(and also add yourself to Phabricator's [ GHC Windows Task Force](https://phabricator.haskell.org/project/view/11/)-Team to get notified about related code-reviews!)

## The Tasks


The list of known problems tagged as Windows issues can be found on Trac (Ticket query: status: !closed, os: Windows, desc: 1, order: id). It would be particularly great if people with commit rights could review the patches in the waitlist.

## The Process


For the time being, let's use the general [ ghc-devs@](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/) mailing list for coordination. As always, before starting any major work it's a good idea to shoot an email to ghc-devs@ and to file a Trac issue (or add a comment on an existing issue) to claim it.
