# GHC Commentary: The Compiler


The compiler itself is written entirely in Haskell, and lives in the many sub-directories of the [compiler](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler) directory.  

- [Compiler Module Dependencies](module-dependencies) (deals with the arcane mutual recursions among GHC's many data types)
- [Coding guidelines](commentary/coding-style)

- [Command line arguments](commentary/compiler/command-line-args)

  - [Overview](commentary/compiler/hsc-main) gives the big picture.

## Overall Structure


Here is a block diagram of its top-level structure:

[](/trac/ghc/attachment/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/ghc-top.png)


The part called [HscMain](commentary/compiler/hsc-main) deals with compiling a single module.  On top of this is built the **compilation manager** (in blue) that manages the compilation of multiple modules.  It exports an interface called the **GHC API**.  On top of this API are four small front ends:

- GHCi, the interactive environment, is implemented in [ghc/InteractiveUI.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/ghc/InteractiveUI.hs) and [compiler/main/InteractiveEval.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/main/InteractiveEval.hs). It sits squarely on top of the GHC API.

- `--make` is almost a trivial client of the GHC API, and is implemented in [compiler/main/GhcMake.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/main/GhcMake.hs). 

- `-M`, the Makefile dependency generator, is also a client of the GHC API and is implemented in [compiler/main/DriverMkDepend.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/main/DriverMkDepend.hs). 

- The "one-shot" mode, where GHC compiles each file on the command line separately (eg. `ghc -c Foo.hs`). This mode bypasses the GHC API, and is implemented
  directly on top of [HscMain](commentary/compiler/hsc-main), since it compiles only one file at a time. In fact, this is all that   
  GHC consisted of prior to version 5.00 when GHCi and `--make` were introduced.


GHC is packaged as a single binary in which all of these front-ends are present, selected by the command-line flags indicated above.  There is a single command-line interface implemented in [ghc/Main.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/ghc/Main.hs).


In addition, GHC is compiled, without its front ends, as a *library* which can be imported by any Haskell program; see [the GHC API](commentary/compiler/api).
