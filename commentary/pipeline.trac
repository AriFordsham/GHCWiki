= The compilation pipeline =

When GHC compiles a module, it calls other programs, and generates a series of intermediate files.  Here's a summary of the process.
(source reference: {{{ghc/compiler/main/DriverPipeline.hs}}})

We start with {{{Foo.hs}}} or {{{Foo.lhs}}}, the "l" specifing whether literate style is being used.

 * Run the '''unlit pre-processor''', {{{unlit}}}, to remove the literate markup, generating {{{Foo.lpp}}}.  The {{{unlit}}} processor is a C program kept in [[GhcFile(utils/unlit)]].

 * Run the '''C preprocessor''', `cpp`, (if {{{-cpp}}} is specified), generating {{{Foo.hspp}}}.

 * Run '''the compiler itself'''. This does not start a separate process; it's just a call to a Haskell function.  This step always generates an [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/IfaceFiles '''interface file'''] {{{Foo.hi}}}, and depending on what flags you give, it also generates a compiled file:
   * Assembly code: flag {{{-S}}}, file {{{Foo.s}}}
   * C code: flag {{{-fvia-C}}}, file {{{Foo.hc}}}
   * C-- mode: flag {{{-fcmm}}}, file {{{Foo.cmm}}}, believed not to work

  * In the {{{-fvia-C}}} case:
    * Run the '''C compiler''' on `Foo.hc`, to generate `Foo.raw_s`.
    * Run the [wiki:Commentary/EvilMangler Evil Mangler], generating {{{Foo.s}}}

  * If `-split-objs` is in force, run the '''splitter''' on `Foo.s`.  This splits `Foo.s` into lots of small files.  The idea is that the static linker will thereby avoid linking dead code.

  * Run the assembler on `Foo.s` or, if `-split-objs` in in force, on each individual assembly file.

The '''compiler itself''', independent of the external tools, is also structured as a pipeline.  For details (and a diagram), see [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/HscMain]
