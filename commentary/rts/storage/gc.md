# The Garbage Collector


GC concepts:

- [Aging](commentary/rts/storage/gc/aging)
- [Pinned objects](commentary/rts/storage/gc/pinned)
- [Roots](commentary/rts/storage/gc/roots)
- [Eager promotion](commentary/rts/storage/gc/eager-promotion)
- [Remembered sets](commentary/rts/storage/gc/remembered-sets)
- [Weak pointers and finalizers](commentary/rts/storage/gc/weak)
- [CAFs](commentary/rts/storage/gc/ca-fs)


GC algorithms supported:

- [Copying GC](commentary/rts/storage/gc/copying)
- Parallel GC?
- Marking? (for compaction or sweeping)
- Compaction?
- Sweeping? (for mark-region GC)
- [Immix](commentary/rts/storage/gc/immix) (not supported yet)

## GC overview


The GC is designed to be flexible, supporting lots of ways to tune its behaviour.  Here's an overview of the techniques we use:

- Generational GC, with a runtime-selectable number of generations (`+RTS -G<n> -RTS`, where `n >= 1`).  Currently it is a
  traditional generational collector where each collection collects a particular generation and all younger generations.
  Generalizing this such that any subset of generations can be collected is a possible future extension.

- The heap grows on demand.  This is straightforwardly implemented by basing the whole storage manager on a [block allocator](commentary/rts/storage/block-alloc).

- Aging: objects can be aged within a generation, to avoid premature promotion.  See [Commentary/Rts/Storage/GC/Aging](commentary/rts/storage/gc/aging).

- The heap collection policy is runtime-tunable.  You select how large a generation gets before it is collected using the `+RTS -F<n> -RTS` option, where `<n>` is a factor of the generation's size the last time it was collected.  The default value is 2, that is a generation is allowed to double in size before being collected.

## GC data structures

[includes/rts/storage/GC.h](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/includes/rts/storage/GC.h)

### generation


The main data structure is `generation`, which contains:

<table><tr><th>`blocks`</th>
<td>
a pointer to a list of blocks
</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><th>`large_objects`</th>
<td>
a pointer to a list of blocks containing large objects
</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><th>`threads`</th>
<td>
a list of threads in this generation
</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><th>`mut_list`</th>
<td>
the [remembered set](commentary/rts/storage/gc/remembered-sets), a list of blocks containing pointers to objects in *this* generation that point to objects in *younger* generations
</td></tr></table>


and various other administrative fields (see [includes/rts/storage/GC.h](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/includes/rts/storage/GC.h) for the details).


Generations are kept in the array `generations[]`, indexed by the generation number.

### nursery


A `nursery` is a list of blocks into which the mutator allocates new (small) objects.  For resaons of locality, we want to re-use the list of blocks for the nursery after each GC, so we keep the nursery blocks rather than freeing and re-allocating a new nursery after GC.


The struct `nursery` contains only two fields

<table><tr><th>`blocks`</th>
<td>
the list of blocks in this nursery
</td></tr>
<tr><th>`n_blocks`</th>
<td>
the number of blocks in the above list
</td></tr></table>


In the threaded RTS, there is one nursery per Capability, as each Capability allocates independently into its own allocation area.  Nurseries are therefore stored in an array `nurseries[]`, indexed by Capability number.


The blocks of the nursery notionally logically to generation 0, although they are not kept on the list `generations[0].blocks`.  The reason is that we want to keep the actual nursery blocks separate from any blocks containing live data in generation 0.  Generation 0 may contain live data for two reasons:

- objects live in the nursery are not promoted to generation 1 immediately, instead they are [aged](commentary/rts/storage/gc/aging), first being copied to generation 0, and then being promoted to generation 1 in the next GC cycle if they are still alive.

- If there is only one generation (generation 0), then live objects in generation 0 are retained in generation 0 after a GC.
