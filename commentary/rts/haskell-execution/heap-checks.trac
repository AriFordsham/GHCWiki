When allocating a heap object, we bump `Hp` and compare to `HpLim`. If the test fails we branch to ???.  Usually this code tests an interrupt flag (to see if execution should be brought tidily to a halt); grabs the next block of allocation space; makes `Hp` point to it and `HpLim` to its end; and returns.  If there are no more allocation-space blocks, garbage collection is triggered.
