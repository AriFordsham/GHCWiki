# The user manual


GHC's user manual contains documentation intended for users of GHC.  They are not interested in how GHC works; they just want to use it.


The user manual is held in [docs/users_guide](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/docs/users_guide), and is written in ReStructuredText format (`.rst` files).  This allows us to typeset it as HTML pages, or as LaTeX.
The user manual is rendered like [ this page](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/).


See also the [notes on building the documentation](building/docs).


See the [ Care and feeding of your GHC User's Guide](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/editing-guide.html) section for conventions and a basic introduction to ReST.
