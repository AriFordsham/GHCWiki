= Primitive Operations (!PrimOps) =

!PrimOps are functions that cannot be implemented in Haskell, and are provided natively by GHC.  For example, adding two {{{Int#}}} values is provided as the !PrimOp {{{+#}}}, and allocating a new mutable array is the !PrimOp {{{newArray#}}}.

!PrimOps are made available to Haskell code through the virtual module {{{GHC.Prim}}}.  This module has no implementation, and its interface never resides on disk: if {{{GHC.Prim}}} is imported, we use a built-in {{{ModIface}}} value - see {{{ghcPrimIface}}} in [[GhcFile(compiler/iface/LoadIface.hs)]].

It would also be useful to look at the [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/WiredIn Wired-in and known-key things] wiki page to understand this topic.

== The primops.txt.pp file ==

The file [[GhcFile(compiler/prelude/primops.txt.pp)]] includes all the information the compiler needs to know about a !PrimOp, bar its actual implementation.  For each !PrimOp, {{{primops.txt.pp}}} lists:

 * Its name, as it appears in Haskell code (eg. int2Integer#)
 * Its type
 * The name of its constructor in GHC's {{{PrimOp}}} data type.
 * Various properties, such as whether the operation is commutable, or has side effects.

For example, here's the integer multiplication !PrimOp:

{{{
primop   IntegerMulOp   "timesInteger#" GenPrimOp   
   Int# -> ByteArr# -> Int# -> ByteArr# -> (# Int#, ByteArr# #)
   with commutable = True
        out_of_line = True
}}}

The {{{primops.txt.pp}}} file is processed first by CPP, and then by the {{{genprimopcode}}} program (see [[GhcFile(utils/genprimopcode)]]).  {{{genprimopcode}}} generates the following bits from {{{primops.txt.pp}}}:

 * Various files that are {{{#include}}}d into [[GhcFile(compiler/prelude/PrimOp.hs)]],
   containing declarations of data types and functions describing the !PrimOps.  See
   [[GhcFile(compiler/Makefile)]].

 * {{{libraries/base/GHC/PrimopWrappers.hs}}}, a file that contains (curried) wrapper
   functions for each of the !PrimOps, so that they are accessible from byte-code, and
   so that the [wiki:Commentary/Rts/Interpreter byte-code interpreter] doesn't need to implement any !PrimOps at all: it
   just invokes the compiled ones from {{{GHC.PrimopWrappers}}}.

 * {{{libraries/ghc-prim/dist-install/build/autogen/GHC/Prim.hs}}}, a generated source file containing dummy declarations for
   all the !PrimOps, solely so that Haddock can include documentation for {{{GHC.Prim}}}
   in its documentation for the {{{base}}} package.  The file {{{GHC/Prim.hs}}} is never
   actually compiled, only processed by Haddock.

Note that if you want to create a polymorphic primop, you need to return {{{(# a #)}}}, not {{{a}}}.

== Implementation of !PrimOps ==

!PrimOps are divided into two categories for the purposes of implementation: inline and out-of-line.

=== Inline !PrimOps ===

Inline !PrimOps are operations that can be compiled into a short sequence of code that never needs to allocate, block, or return to the scheduler for any reason.  An inline !PrimOp is compiled directly into [wiki:Commentary/Rts/Cmm Cmm] by the [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/CodeGen code generator].  The code for doing this is in [[GhcFile(compiler/codeGen/StgCmmPrim.hs)]].

=== Out-of-line !PrimOps ===

All other !PrimOps are classified as out-of-line, and are implemented by hand-written C-- code in the file [[GhcFile(rts/PrimOps.cmm)]].  An out-of-line !PrimOp is like a Haskell function, except that

 * !PrimOps cannot be partially applied.  Calls to all !PrimOps are made at the correct arity; this is ensured by 
   the [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/HscMain CorePrep] pass.

 * Out-of-line !PrimOps have a special, fixed, [wiki:Commentary/Rts/HaskellExecution#CallingConvention calling convention]:
   all arguments
   are in the [wiki:Commentary/Rts/HaskellExecution#Registers registers] R1-R8.  This is to make it easy to write the
   C-- code for these !PrimOps: we don't have to write code for multiple calling conventions.

It's possible to provide inline versions of out-of-line !PrimOps. This is useful when we have enough static information to generated a short, more efficient inline version. For example, a call to {{{newArray# 8# init}}} can be implemented more efficiently as an inline !PrimOp as the heap check for the array allocation can be combined with the heap check for the surrounding code. See `shouldInlinePrimOp` in [[GhcFile(compiler/codeGen/StgCmmPrim.hs)]].

=== Foreign out-of-line !PrimOps and `foreign import prim` ===

A new and somewhat more flexible form of out-of-line !PrimOp is the foreign out-of-line !PrimOp. These are essentially the same but instead of their Cmm code being included in the RTS, they can be defined in Cmm code in any package and instead of knowledge of the !PrimOp being baked into the compiler, they can be imported using special FFI syntax:

{{{
foreign import prim "int2Integerzh"
  int2Integer# :: Int# -> (# Int#, ByteArray# #)
}}}

The string (e.g. "int2Integerzh") is the linker name of the Cmm function. Using this syntax requires the extensions `ForeignFunctionInterface`, `GHCForeignImportPrim`, `MagicHash`, `UnboxedTuples` and `UnliftedFFITypes`. The current type restriction is that all arguments and results must be unlifted types, with two additional possibilities: An argument may (since GHC 7.5) be of type `Any` (in which case the called function will receive a pointer to the heap), and the result type is allowed to be an unboxed tuple. The calling convention is exactly the same as for ordinary out-of-line primops. Currently it is not possible to specify any of the !PrimOp attributes.

The `integer-gmp` package now uses this method for all the primops that deal with GMP big integer values. The advantage of using this technique is that it is a bit more modular. The RTS does not need to include all the primops. For example in the integer case the RTS no longer needs to link against the GMP C library.

The future direction is to extend this syntax to allow !PrimOp attributes to be specified. The calling convention for primops and ordinary compiled Haskell functions may be unified in future and at that time it the restriction on using only unlifted types may be lifted.

It has been suggested that we extend this !PrimOp definition and import method to cover all !PrimOps, even inline ones. This would replace the current `primops.txt.pp` system of builtin !PrimOps. The inline !PrimOps would still be defined in the compiler but they would be imported in any module via `foreign import prim` rather than appearing magically to be exported from the `GHC.Prim` module. Hugs has used a similar system for years (with the syntax `primitive seq :: a -> b -> b`).

== Adding a new !PrimOp ==

To add a new primop, you currently need to update the following files:

 * [[GhcFile(compiler/prelude/primops.txt.pp)]], which includes the
   type of the primop, and various other properties.  Syntax and
   examples are in the file.

 * if the primop is inline, then:
   [[GhcFile(compiler/codeGen/StgCmmPrim.hs)]] defines the translation of
   the primop into {{{Cmm}}}.
		
 * for an out-of-line primop:
   * [[GhcFile(includes/stg/MiscClosures.h)]] (just add the declaration),
   * [[GhcFile(rts/PrimOps.cmm)]] (implement it here)
   * [[GhcFile(rts/Linker.c)]] (declare the symbol for GHCi)

 * for a foreign out-of-line primop You do not need to modify the rts or compiler at all.
   * `yourpackage/cbits/primops.cmm`: implement your primops here. You have to arrange for the .cmm file to be compiled and linked into the package. The GHC build system has support for this. Cabal does not yet.
   * `yourpackage/TheCode.hs`: use `foreign import prim` to import the primops.

{{{#!box information
'''Note:''' In case of compile errors like
{{{
Not in scope: ‘GHC.Prim.<newPrimOp>’
}}}
run `make clean` so the build system will pick up changes to the generated `GHC.Prim` module.
}}}

In addition, if new primtypes are being added, the following files need to be updated:
  * [[GhcFile(utils/genprimopcode/Main.hs)]] -- extend ppType :: Type -> String function
  
  * [[GhcFile(compiler/prelude/PrelNames.hs)]] -- add a new unique id using mkPreludeTyConUnique

  * [[GhcFile(compiler/prelude/TysPrim.hs)]] -- there are a raft of changes here; you need to create {{{*PrimTy}}}, {{{*PrimTyCon}}} and  {{{*PrimTyConName}}} variables. The most important thing to make sure you get right is when you make a PrimTyCon, you pick the correct {{{PrimRep}}} for your type.  For example, if you’ve introduced a new GC'able object, you should use {{{PtrRep}}}; however, if it's a pointer that shouldn't be GC'd, you should use {{{AddrRep}}} instead.  The full list is in [[GhcFile(compiler/types/TyCon.hs)]]

== Explanation of attributes ==

`TBV` (To be verified)

=== has_side_effects ===

default = False

=== out_of_line ===

default = False

Set to True if there is a function in !PrimOps.cmm. This also changes to code generator to push the continuation
of any follow on code onto the stack.

=== commutable ===

default = False

=== needs_wrapper ===

default = False

=== strictness ===

default = [lazyDmd, ... ] !TopRes

This is the strictness of the !PrimOp. Unboxed things should be marked as lazyDmd. (Someone explain why?).

=== usage ===

default = nomangle other
