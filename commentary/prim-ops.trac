= Primitive Operations (!PrimOps) =

A !PrimOp is a function that cannot be implemented in Haskell, and are provided natively by GHC.  For example, adding two {{{Int#}}} values is provided as the !PrimOp {{{+#}}}, and allocating a new mutable array is the !PrimOp {{{newArray#}}}.

PrimOps are made available to Haskell code through the virtual module {{{GHC.Prim}}}.  This module has no implementation, and its interface never resides on disk: if {{{GHC.Prim}}} is imported, we use a built-in {{{ModIface}}} value - see {{{ghcPrimIface}}} in [[GhcFile(compiler/iface/LoadIface.lhs)]].
