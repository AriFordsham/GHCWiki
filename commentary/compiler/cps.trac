= CPS Conversion =

This part of the compiler is still under construction and it not presently in ghc-HEAD.
These notes are to document it for when it does get merged in.

== Overview ==
This pass takes Cmm with native proceedure calls and an implicit stack and produces Cmm with only tail calls implemented as jumps and an explicit stack.  In a word, it does CPS conversion.  (All right, so that's two words.)

== Design Aspects ==
 * Proc-Point Analysis
 * Calling Conventions
 * Live Value Analysis
 * Stack Layout

== Simple Design ==
 * Split blocks into multiple blocks at function calls
   * TODO: eliminate extra jump at block ends when there is already a jump at the end of the call
 * Do liveness analysis
 * Split every block into a separate function
 * Pass all live values as parameters (probably slow)
   * Must arrange for both the caller and callee to know argument order
     * Simple design: callee just chooses some order and all callers must comply
   * Eventually could be passed implicitly but keeping things explicit makes things easier
   * Evantually could use a custom calling convention
   * Actual syntax is probably virtual.  (I.e. in an external table, not in actual syntax because that would require changes to the type for Cmm code)
     * Input code:
       {{{
f {
  y = 1;
  z = 2;
  x = call g(a, b); // y, z live
  return x+y+z;
}
}}}
     * Output code:
       {{{
f {
  y = 1;
  z = 2;
  push_continuation h [y, z]; // Probably virtual
  jump g(a, b);
}

foreign "ret" h(x) {
  (y, z) = expand_continuation; // Probably virtual
  return x+y+z;
} 
}}}
 * Save live values before a call in the continuation
   * Must arrange for both the caller and callee to know field order
     * Simple design: callee just chooses some order and all callers must comply
   * Eventually needs to be optimized to reduce continuation shuffling
     * Can register allocation algorithms be unified with this into one framework?

== To be worked out ==
 * The continuations for {{{f}}} and {{{g}}} are different.
   {{{
if (test) {
  x = f();
} else {
  y = g();
}
}}}
   * Could make a for each that shuffles the arguments into a common format.
   * Could make one branch primary and shuffle the other to match it, but that might entail unnessisary memory writes.

== Pipeline ==
 * CPS
   * Make closures and stacks manifest
   * Makes all calls are tail calls
 * Parameter Elimination
   * Makes calling convention explicit
   * For externally visible functions calling conventions is machine specific, but not backend specific because functions compiled from different backends must be be able to call eachother
   * For local functions calling convention can be left up to the backend because it can take advantage of register allocation.
     * However, the first first draft will specify the standard calling convention for all functions even local ones because:
       * It's simpler
       * The C code generator can't handle function parameters because of the Evil Mangler
       * The NCG doesn't yet understand parameters

== TODO ==
 * Downstream
   * Argument passing convention
 * Midstream
   * Support {{{switch}}} (needed by rts/Apply.cmm)
   * More factoring and cleanup/documentation
   * Wiki document the designed choosen
   * Better stack slot selection
   * Foreign function calls
   * Garbage collector
   * Proc points
     * May cause new blocks
     * May cause new functions
     * Lives could be passes either on stack or in arguments
   * Proc grouping of blocks
 * Upstream
   * Have {{{codeGen}}} emit C-- with functions.
