# Kinds


Kinds classify types.  So for example:

```wiki
   Int :: *
   Int -> Int :: *
   Maybe :: * -> *
   Int# :: #
   (# Int, Int #) :: #
```


The base kinds are these:

- "`*`" is the kind of lifted, boxed values. Things like `Int` and `Maybe Float` have kind `*`.
- "`#`" is the kind of unlifted values. Things like `Int#` have kind `#`.
- With the advent of [data type promotion and kind polymorphism](ghc-kinds) we can have a lot more kinds.
- Kinds are in flux with levity polymorphism. See [LevityPolymorphism](levity-polymorphism). See also [TypeType](commentary/compiler/type-type).


(Unboxed tuples used to have a distinct kind, but in 2012 we combined unboxed tuples with other unboxed values in a single kind "`#`".)

## Representing kinds


Kinds are represented by the data type `Type` (see [Commentary/Compiler/TypeType](commentary/compiler/type-type)):

```wiki
type Kind = Type
```


Basic kinds are 
represented using type constructors, e.g. the kind `*` is represented as

```wiki
liftedTypeKind :: Kind
liftedTypeKind = TyConApp liftedTypeKindTyCon []
```


where `liftedTypeKindTyCon` is a built-in `PrimTyCon`.  The arrow type
constructor is used as the arrow kind constructor, e.g. the kind `* -> *` 
is represented internally as

```wiki
FunTy liftedTypeKind liftedTypeKind
```


It's easy to extract the kind of a type, or the sort of a kind:

```wiki
typeKind :: Type -> Kind
```


The "sort" of a kind is always one of the
sorts: `TY` (for kinds that classify normal types) or `CO` (for kinds that
classify coercion evidence).  The coercion kind, `T1 :=: T2`, is
represented by `PredTy (EqPred T1 T2)`.

## Kind subtyping


There is a small amount of sub-typing in kinds.  Suppose you see `(t1 -> t2)`.  What kind must `t1` and `t2` have?  It could be `*` or `#`.  So we have a single kind `OpenKind`, which is a super-kind of both, with this simple lattice:
