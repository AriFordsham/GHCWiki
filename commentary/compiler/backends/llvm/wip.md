# Work in Progress on the LLVM Backend


This page is meant to collect together information about people working on (or interested in working on) LLVM in GHC, and the projects they are looking at.

- David Terei is going to be at Microsoft Research for an internship to work on LLVM at the end of April
- There is interest on working on LLVM as part of the Google Summer of Code

  - The GSoC timeline is May 24th - August 9th ([ http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs\#timeline](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs#timeline)), so this overlaps with David's internship
  - Max Bolingbroke (www.cl.cam.ac.uk/\~mb566) has proposed a SoC project to work on LLVM [ http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/ticket/1582](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/ticket/1582)
  - Alp Mestanogullari ([ http://alpmestan.wordpress.com/](http://alpmestan.wordpress.com/), [ http://twitter.com/alpmestan](http://twitter.com/alpmestan)) is interested in working on a SoC project on LLVM
