# Loopification


Loopification is a C-- optimisation pass that turns tail recursion into proper loops.


Here is a summary of relevant links and tickets

- [ Krzysztof Wos's project](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/tmp/wos-diss-draft.pdf) in which he reports great performance improvements by turning tail recursion into loops in C--. 

- Tickets:

  - [\#8285](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8285)
  - [\#8793](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8793), [\#11372](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/11372); see comment 15 of [\#8793](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8793)) etc, where it seems that we are missing loopification for a simple IO function
  - [\#8585](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8585) concerned getting the loop to start *after* the stack check
