= Support for generic programming =
[[PageOutline]]

GHC includes a new (in 2010) mechanism to let you write generic functions.  It is described in paper [http://www.dreixel.net/research/pdf/gdmh_nocolor.pdf A generic deriving mechanism for Haskell]. This page sketches the specifics of the implementation; we assume you have read the paper. The [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generics HaskellWiki page] gives a more general overview.

This mechanism replaces the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/generic-classes.html previous generic classes implementation]. What we describe until the "Kind polymorphic overhaul" section is implemented and released in GHC 7.2.1.

== Main components ==

 * `TcDeriv.tcDeriving` now allows deriving `Generic` instances.

 * The representation types and core functionality of the library live on `GHC.Generics` (on the `ghc-prim` package).

 * Many names have been added as known in `prelude/PrelNames`

 * Most of the code generation is handled by `types/Generics`

== Things that have been removed ==

 * All of the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/generic-classes.html generic classes stuff]. In particular, the following have been removed:
   * `hasGenerics` field from `TyCon`;
   * `HsNumTy` constructor from `HsType`;
   * `TypePat` constructor from `Pat`.

 * The `-XGenerics` flag is now deprecated.

== What already works ==

 * `Generic` instances can be derived when `-XDeriveGeneric` is enabled.

 * The `default` keyword can used for generic default method signatures when `-XDefaultSignatures` is enabled.

 * Generic defaults are properly instantiated when giving an instance without defining the generic default method.

 * Base types like `[]`, `Maybe`, tuples, come with Generic instances.

== To be done ==

 * Derive `Generic1` instances

== Testing ==

 * Tests are available under the `generics` directory of the testsuite.

= Kind polymorphic overhaul =

With the new `-XPolyKinds` functionality we can make the support for generic programming better typed. The basic idea is to define the universe codes (`M1`, `:+:`, etc.) as constructors of a datatype. Promotion then lifts these constructors to types, which we can use as before, only that now we have them all classified under a new kind. The overhaul of the main module is explained below; for easier comparison with the current approach, names are kept the same whenever possible.

== Generic representation universe ==
`m` is the only real parameter here. `f` and `x` are there because we
can't write kinds directly, since `Universe` is also a datatype (even if
we're only interested in its promoted version). So we pass `f` and `x`
only to set them to `* -> *` and `*`, respectively, in `Interprt`.
`m` is different: it stands for the kind of metadata representation types,
and we really want to be polymorphic over that, since each user datatype
will introduce a new metadata kind.
{{{
data Universe f x m = 
  -- Void (used for datatypes without constructors)
    VV
    
  -- Unit
  | UU
  
  -- The parameter
  | PAR
  
  -- Recursion into a type of kind * -> *
  | REC f
  
  -- Constants (either other parameters or recursion into types of kind *)
  | KK Constant x
  
  -- Metadata
  | MM MetaData m (Universe f x m)
  
  -- Sum, product, composition
  | Universe f x m :++: Universe f x m
  | Universe f x m :**: Universe f x m
  | f :..: Universe f x m
  -- Note that we always compose a concrete type on the left (like []) with
  -- a generic representation on the right

infixr 5 :++:
infixr 6 :**:
infixr 6 :*:
infixr 7 :..:

-- Some shortcuts
data MetaData = CC | DD | SS
data Constant = PP | RR

data ConstantV (c :: Constant) where
  P :: ConstantV PP
  R :: ConstantV RR
  
data MetaDataV (m :: MetaData) where
  C :: MetaDataV CC
  D :: MetaDataV DD
  S :: MetaDataV SS
}}}

== Universe interpretation ==

As promised, we set `f` to `* -> *` and `x` to `*`.
Unfortunately we don't have [GhcKinds#Explicitkindvariables explicit kind variable annotations]
yet, so we cannot leave `m` polymorphic! So this code doesn't compile:
{{{
data Interprt :: Universe (* -> *) * m -> * -> * where

  -- No interpretation for VV, as it shouldn't map to any value
  
  -- Unit
  U1     :: Interprt UU p
  
  -- The parameter
  Par1   :: p -> Interprt PAR p
  
  -- Recursion into a type of kind * -> *
  Rec1   :: r p -> Interprt (REC r) p
  
  -- Constants
  K1     :: x -> Interprt (KK c x) p
  -- Constants shortcuts
  Par0   :: x -> Interprt (KK PP x) p
  Rec0   :: x -> Interprt (KK RR x) p
  
  -- Metadata
  M1     :: Interprt x p -> Interprt (MM m c x) p
  -- Metadata shortcuts
  D1     :: Interprt x p -> Interprt (MM DD c x) p
  C1     :: Interprt x p -> Interprt (MM CC c x) p
  S1     :: Interprt x p -> Interprt (MM SS c x) p
  
  -- Sum, product, and composition
  L1     :: Interprt a r -> Interprt (a :++: b) r
  R1     :: Interprt b r -> Interprt (a :++: b) r
  (:*:)  :: Interprt a r -> Interprt b r -> Interprt (a :**: b) r
  Comp1  :: f (Interprt g r) -> Interprt (f :..: g) r
}}}

=== Names ===

As an aside, note that we have to come up with names like `UU` and `KK` for the `Universe`
even though we really just wanted to use `U1` and `K1`, like before. Then we would have
a type and a constructor with the same name, but that's ok. However, `Universe` defines
both a type (with constructors) and a kind (with types). So if we were to use `U1` in the
`Universe` constructors, then we could no longer use that name in the `Interprt`
constructors. It's a bit annoying, because we are never really interested in the type
`Universe` and its constructors: we're only interested in its promoted variant.
This is a slight annoyance of automatic promotion: when you define a "singleton type"
(like our GADT `Interprt` for `Universe`) you cannot reuse the constructor names.


== Metadata representation ==
{{{
data Proxy d = Proxy -- kind polymorphic

-- Meta data classes
class Datatype d where -- kind polymorphic
  -- The name of the datatype, fully qualified
  datatypeName :: Proxy d -> String
}}}
There's more of these, but they don't add any new concerns.


== Conversion between user datatypes and generic representation ==

We now get a more precise kind for `Rep`:

{{{
-- Representable types of kind *
class Generic a where
  type Rep a :: Universe (* -> *) * m
  from :: a -> Interprt (Rep a) x
  to   :: Interprt (Rep a) x -> a
  
-- Representable types of kind * -> *
class Generic1 (f :: * -> *) where
  type Rep1 f :: Universe (* -> *) * m
  from1  :: f a -> Interprt (Rep1 f) a
  to1    :: Interprt (Rep1 f) a -> f a
}}}
  
== Example generic function: `fmap` (kind `* -> *`) ==

User-visible class, exported:
{{{
class Functor (f :: * -> *) where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  default fmap :: (Generic1 f, GFunctor (Rep1 f)) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  fmap f = to1 . gfmap f . from1  
}}}

Defined by the generic programmer, not exported:
{{{
class GFunctor (f :: Universe (* -> *) * m) where
  gfmap :: (a -> b) -> Interprt f a -> Interprt f b
  
instance GFunctor UU where
  gfmap _ U1 = U1
  
instance GFunctor PAR where
  gfmap f (Par1 a) = Par1 (f a)

instance GFunctor (KK i c) where
  gfmap _ (K1 a) = K1 a

instance (Functor f) => GFunctor (REC f) where
  gfmap f (Rec1 a) = Rec1 (fmap f a)

instance (GFunctor f) => GFunctor (MM m c f) where
  gfmap f (M1 a) = M1 (gfmap f a)

instance (GFunctor f, GFunctor g) => GFunctor (f :++: g) where
  gfmap f (L1 a) = L1 (gfmap f a)
  gfmap f (R1 a) = R1 (gfmap f a)

instance (GFunctor f, GFunctor g) => GFunctor (f :**: g) where
  gfmap f (a :*: b) = gfmap f a :*: gfmap f b

instance (Functor f, GFunctor g) => GFunctor (f :..: g) where
  gfmap f (Comp1 x) = Comp1 (fmap (gfmap f) x)
}}}

Note that previously `Functor` and `GFunctor` had exactly the same types.
Now we can make clear what the difference between them is.
  
== Example generic function: `show` (kind `*`, uses metadata) ==

User-visible class, exported:
{{{
class Show (a :: *) where
  show :: a -> String
  default show :: (Generic a, GShow (Rep a)) => a -> String
  show = gshow . from
}}}
  
Defined by the generic programmer, not exported:
{{{
class GShow (f :: Universe (* -> *) * m) where
  gshow :: Interprt f x -> String
  
instance GShow UU where
  gshow U1 = ""
  
instance (P.Show c) => GShow (KK i c) where
  gshow (K1 a) = P.show a
  
instance (Datatype c, GShow f) => GShow (MM DD c f) where
  gshow (M1 x) = datatypeName (Proxy :: Proxy c) ++ " " ++ gshow x
}}}

The other cases do not add any further complexity.
  
  
== Example datatype encoding: lists (derived by the compiler) ==
{{{  
instance Generic [a] where
  type Rep [a] = MM DD DList 
                   (MM CC DList_Nil UU :++: 
                    MM CC DList_Cons (KK PP a :**: KK RR [a]))

  from [] = D1 (L1 (C1 U1))
  from (h:t) = D1 (R1 (C1 (Par0 h :*: Rec0 t)))
  to (D1 (L1 (C1 U1))) = []
  to (D1 (R1 (C1 (Par0 h :*: Rec0 t)))) = h:t
  
-- Metadata
data List_Meta = DList | DList_Nil | DList_Cons
}}}

Note that we use only one datatype; more correct would be to use 3, one for
`DList`, another for the constructors, and yet another for the selectors
(or maybe even n datatypes for the selectors, one for each constructor?)
But we don't do that because `Universe` is polymorphic only over `m`, so
a single metadata representation type. If we want a more fine-grained
distinction then we would need more parameters in `Universe`, and also to
split the `MM` case.
{{{
instance Datatype DList where datatypeName _ = "[]"
}}}
  
=== Digression ===
Even better would be to index the metadata representation types over
the type they refer to. Something like:
{{{
  data family MetaTypes a -- kind polymorphic
  data instance MetaTypes [] = DList | DList_Nil | DList_Cons
}}}
But now we are basically asking for promotion of data families, since we want
to use promoted `DList`. Also, the case for `MM` in `Universe` would then
be something like:
{{{
  | MM MetaData (MetaTypes m) (Universe f x m)
}}}
But I'm not entirely sure about this.

== A more conservative first approach to this problem ==

Because what we've described so far is rather backwards-incompatible, we could at least try to improve the encoding of metadata, which is currently rather clunky (giving rise to lots of empty, compiler-generated datatypes and respective instances). We can do that by changing `M1` to keep the meta-information ''at the type level'':
{{{
newtype M1 i (c :: Meta) f p = M1 { unM1 :: f p }

data Meta = MetaData Symbol Symbol  Bool
          | MetaCons Symbol FixityI Bool
          | MetaSel  Symbol

data Fixity  = Prefix  | Infix  Associativity Int
data FixityI = PrefixI | InfixI Associativity Nat

data Associativity = LeftAssociative
                   | RightAssociative
                   | NotAssociative
}}}

Why do we need to add `FixityI`? Because `Fixity` does not promote. Yet, we want to expose `Fixity` to the user, not `FixityI`. Note that the meta-data classes remain unchanged:
{{{
class Datatype d where
  datatypeName :: t d (f :: * -> *) a -> [Char]
  moduleName   :: t d (f :: * -> *) a -> [Char]
  isNewtype    :: t d (f :: * -> *) a -> Bool

class Constructor c where
  conName :: t c (f :: * -> *) a -> [Char]
  conFixity :: t c (f :: * -> *) a -> Fixity
  conIsRecord :: t c (f :: * -> *) a -> Bool

class Selector s where
  selName :: t s (f :: * -> *) a -> [Char]
}}}

But now, using the magic of singletons, we can give ''one single instance'' for each of these classes, instead of having to instantiate them each time a user derives `Generic`:
{{{
instance (KnownSymbol n, KnownSymbol m, SingI nt)
    => Datatype (MetaData n m nt) where
  datatypeName _ = symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy n)
  moduleName   _ = symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy m)
  isNewtype    _ = fromSing  (sing  :: Sing nt)

instance (KnownSymbol n, SingI f, SingI r)
    => Constructor (MetaCons n f r) where
  conName     _ = symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy n)
  conFixity   _ = fromSing  (sing  :: Sing f)
  conIsRecord _ = fromSing  (sing  :: Sing r)

instance (KnownSymbol s) => Selector (MetaSel s) where
  selName _ = symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy s)
}}}

Naturally, we require singletons for `Bool`, `FixityI`, and `Associativity`, but that is one time boilerplate code, and is not visible for the user. (In particular, this is where we encode that the demotion of (the kind) `FixityI` is (the type) `Fixity`.)

I believe this change is almost fully backwards-compatible, and lets us simplify the code for `deriving Generic` in GHC. Furthermore, I suspect it will be useful to writers of generic functions, who can now match at the type-level on things such as whether a constructor is a record or not.

I say "almost fully backwards-compatible" because handwritten `Generic` instances might break with this change. But we've never recommended doing this, and I think users who do this are more than aware that they shouldn't rely on it working across different versions of GHC.

= Using standard deriving for generic functions =

Currently, users can instantiate a generic function to their datatypes by doing the following:

1. Attaching a `deriving Generic` clause to their datatype declaration:
{{{
data MyDatatype = .... deriving Generic
}}}
2. Giving an empty instance:
{{{
instance GBinary MyDatatype
}}}

However, it would be more natural and concise to simply be able to write:
{{{
data MyDatatype = .... deriving (Generic, GBinary)
}}}

Ultimately, this might even allow us to replace the generated code by classes such as `Eq`, `Ord`, etc. with plain generic code.

The ticket for this request is #5462. We refer to this new feature as `DeriveAnyClass`.

== Which classes can be derived? ==

How do we figure out which classes will now be allowed as part of a deriving clause? We don't; we allow any class! Although the feature makes more sense for classes whose [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/pragmas.html#minimal-pragma `MINIMAL` set] is empty, it'll work for any other class too. It simply generates an instance without any method definitions.

== Interaction with `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` ==

[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/deriving.html#newtype-deriving `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`] (GND) already allows many non-standard classes to be derived, but:
1. It means something different from ordinary deriving. Instead of generating new code for the instance, GHC simply uses the instance for the type inside the newtype.
2. As such, this only works when deriving newtypes, and
3. The classes `Read`, `Show`, `Typeable`, `Data`, and `Generic` even with `GND on, give rise to standard instances. That is, in the following deriving clause
{{{
newtype MyInt = MyInt Int deriving (Eq, Num, Show)
}}}
`Eq` and `Num` operations will simply be lifted through the newtype coercion, but `show (MyInt 3)` will still print `MyInt 3`, not just `3`.

GND interacts with `DeriveAnyClass` because both are about generating instances for arbitrary classes, but they do it in different ways. There are multiple ways to handle this.

==== 1. Disallow `DeriveAnyClass` for newtypes ====

In this case we simply do not allow `GeneralizedDeriving` for newtypes. It's simple to implement, but it's a bit limiting, in that if you happen to be using newtypes for which you want generic instances, you have to go back to manually writing down the empty instances.

==== 2. Try both approaches, fail if there's ambiguity ====

In many cases it will be clear whether the user wants GND or the new `DeriveAnyClass`:
1. If GND is on, and `DeriveAnyClass` is off, then we do GND.
2. Conversely, if GND is off, and `DeriveAnyClass` is on, then we do the latter.
3. If both are on, we pick the `DeriveAnyClass` approach.

The problem with this approach is that in situation 3 users are left in a bad situation if they actually wanted GND; they'll have to manually write a `Coercible` instance, which is not nice.


==== 3. Let class authors specify how their classes should be derived ====

Right now we already treat some classes specially for GND: `Read`, `Show`, `Typeable`, `Data`, and `Generic` are derivable, but not via GND. We could make it a property of the class to say "do not use GND" in deriving clauses. In that case, we know that we can use the `DeriveAnyClass` strategy for newtypes instead.

Maybe we don't even need to make this user-controllable; a handful of built-in classes may suffice.


==== 4. Let users annotate their deriving clauses ====

We could even let users specify which of the two types of deriving they want:
{{{
newtype MyInt = MyInt Int deriving (newtype GBinary, default GShow)
}}}
Here, we re-use the keywords `newtype` and `default` to specify that the `GBinary` instance should be created using GND (so that we do not have the unnecessary extra tag in the binary encoding), but `GShow` should use the "generic" instance (so that we still print "MyInt").

Of course, then we'd need to:
1. Agree on the syntax;
2. Decide what to do when users ask for e.g. `... deriving (newtype Typeable)`.


== Standard vs. Standalone deriving ==

There's no reason to restrict this new deriving form to be attached to a datatype. Users should be free to write the following, if they wish:
{{{
deriving instance (GBinary a) => GBinary (Maybe a)
}}}
... even though the following would do exactly the same with 9 characters less:
{{{
instance (GBinary a) => GBinary (Maybe a)
}}}

== Figuring out the context ==

The only non-trivial part of actually generating the instances from a deriving clause is that now we have to figure out the context. Previously the user would have written
{{{
data MyMaybe a ... deriving Generic
instance (GBinary a) => GBinary (MyMaybe a)
}}}
Now they'll simply write
{{{
data MyMaybe a ... deriving (Generic, GBinary)
}}}
So it's now up to us to find out that the instance needs a `GBinary a =>` head.

For this we propose using the already existing strategy in GHC. Consider the following case:
{{{
class GBinary  (a :: *)      where ...
class GFunctor (f :: * -> *) where ...

data MyMaybe a ... deriving (Generic, GBinary, GFunctor)
}}}
The instance head for the `GBinary (MyMaybe a)` instance will be guessed in the same way as if we were deriving an `Eq` instance. The instance head for the `GFunctor MyMaybe` instance will be guessed in the same way as if we were deriving a `Functor` instance.

The context might end up not being exactly what the user intended. For example, the class being derived might not require instances for each of the type arguments of the datatype. We ''could'' try to figure this out in a clever way from the definition of the class being derived, but this is very hard in general. So, in this case, we just leave the user to specify the context manually via standalone deriving (or, well, just giving an empty instance with a context, as they had to do before).
