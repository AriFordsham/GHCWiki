This page describes code generator ("codegen") in GHC. It is meant to reflect current state of the implementation. If you notice any inacurracies please update the page (if you know how) or complain on ghc-devs.

== A brief history of code generator ==

You might ocasionally hear about "old" and "new" code generator. GHC 7.6 and earlier used the old code generator. New code generator was being developed since 2007 and it was [changeset:832077ca5393d298324cb6b0a2cb501e27209768/ghc enabled by default on 31 August 2012] after the release of GHC 7.6.1. The first stable GHC to use the new code generator is 7.8.1 released in early 2014. The commentary on the old code generator can be found [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/OldCodeGen here]. Notes from the development process of the new code generator are located in a couple of pages on the wiki - go to [wiki:TitleIndex Index] and look for pages starting with "!NewCodeGen".

There are some plans for the future development of code generator. One plan is to expand the capability of the pipeline so that it does native code generation too so that existing backends can be discarded - see [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/IntegratedCodeGen IntegratedCodeGen] for discussion of the design. It is hard to say if this will ever happen as currently there is no work being done on that subject and in the meanwhile there was an alternative proposal to [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/Backends/LLVM/ReplacingNCG replace native code generator with LLVM].

== Overview ==

The goal of the code generator is to convert program from [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/GeneratedCode STG] representation to [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/CmmType Cmm] representation. STG is a functional language with explicit stack. Cmm is a low-level imperative language - something between C and assembly - that is suitable for machine code generation. Note that terminology might be a bit confusing here: the term "code generator" can refer both to STG->Cmm pass and the whole STG->Cmm->assembly pass. The Cmm->assembly conversion is performed by one the backends, eg. NCG (Native Code Generator or LLVM.

The top-most entry point to the codegen is located in [[GhcFile(compiler/main/HscMain.hs)]] in the `tryNewCodegen` function. Code generation is done in two stages:
  1. Convert STG to Cmm with implicit stack, and native Cmm calls. This whole stage lives in [[GhcFile(compiler/codeGen)]] directory with the entry point being `codeGen` function in [[GhcFile(compiler/codeGen/StgCmm.hs)]] module.
  2. Optimise the Cmm, and CPS-convert it to have an explicit stack, and no native calls. This lives in [[GhcFile(compiler/cmm)]] directory with the `cmmPipeline` function from [[GhcFile(compiler/cmm/CmmPipeline.hs)]] module being the entry point.

The CPS-converted Cmm is fed to one of the backends. This is done by `codeOutput` function ([[GhcFile(compiler/main/CodeOutput.lhs)]] called from `hscGenHardCode` after returning from `tryNewCodegen`.

== First stage: STG to Cmm conversion == 

 * '''Code generator''' converts STG to `CmmGraph`.  Implemented in `StgCmm*` modules (in directory `codeGen`). 
   * `Cmm.CmmGraph` is pretty much a Hoopl graph of `CmmNode.CmmNode` nodes. Control transfer instructions are always the last node of a basic block.
   * Parameter passing is made explicit; the calling convention depends on the target architecture.  The key function is `CmmCallConv.assignArgumentsPos`. 
     * Parameters are passed in virtual registers R1, R2 etc. [These map 1-1 to real registers.] 
     * Overflow parameters are passed on the stack using explicit memory stores, to locations described abstractly using the [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/StackAreas ''Stack Area'' abstraction.].   
     * Making the calling convention explicit includes an explicit store instruction of the return address, which is stored explicitly on the stack in the same way as overflow parameters. This is done (obscurely) in `StgCmmMonad.mkCall`.

== Second stage: the Cmm pipeline ==

The core of the Cmm pipeline is implemented by the `cpsTop` function in [[GhcFile(compiler/cmm/CmmPipeline.hs)]] module. The pipeline consists of following passes:

 * '''Control Flow Optimisations''', implemented in `CmmContFlowOpt`, simplifies the control flow graph by:
   * Eliminating blocks that have only one predecessor by concatenating them with that predecessor
   * Shortcuting targets of branches and calls (see Note [What is shortcutting])
  
 If a block becomes unreachable because of shortcutting it is eliminated from the graph. However, '''it is theoretically possible that this pass will produce unreachable blocks'''. The reason is the label renaming pass performed after block concatenation has been completed.

 This pass might be optionally called for the second time at the end of the pipeline.

 * '''Common Block Elimination''', implemented in `CmmCommonBlockElim`, eliminates blocks that are identical (except for the label on their first node). Since this pass traverses blocks in depth-first order any unreachable blocks introduced by Control Flow Optimisations are eliminated. '''This pass is optional.'''

 * '''Determine proc-points''', implemented in `CmmProcPoint`. Proc-point analysis is done only when proc-point splitting is turned on. This is important for the LLVM backend. Proc-point are blocks in the graph that can be turned into entry points of procedures and proc-point splitting splits one function into many smaller ones. Initially we assume that entry point to a graph as well as continuation of every call is a proc-point. Then we look for blocks reachable from multiple proc-points and turn such blocks into a proc-point.

 * '''Figure out the stack layout''', implemented in `CmmStackLayout`.
   * Each variable 'x', and each proc-point label 'K', has an associated ''Area'', written SS(x) and SS(k) resp, that names a contiguous portion of the stack frame.  
   * The stack layout pass produces a mapping of: ''(`Area` -> `StackOffset`)''. For more detail, see [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/StackAreas#Layingoutthestack the description of stack layout.]
   * A `StackOffset` is the byte offset of a stack slot from the old end (high address) of the frame.  It doesn't vary as the physical stack pointer moves.

 * '''Manifest the stack pointer''', implemented in `CmmStackLayout`.  Once the stack layout mapping has been determined, a second pass walks over the graph, making the stack pointer, `Sp` explicit. Before this pass, there is no `Sp` at all.  After this, `Sp` is completely manifest.
   * replacing references to `Areas` with offsets from `Sp`.
   * adding adjustments to `Sp`.
 
 * '''Sinking assignments''', implemented in `CmmSink`, performs these optimizations:
   * moves assignments closer to their uses, to reduce register pressure
   * pushes assignments into a single branch of a conditional if possible
   * inlines assignments to registers that are mentioned only once
   * discards dead assignments

 '''This pass is optional.''' It currently does not eliminate dead code in loops (#8327) and has some other minor deficiencies (eg. #8336).

  * '''CAF analysis''', implemented in `CmmBuildInfoTables`. Computed CAF information is returned from `cmmPipeline` and used to create Static Reference Tables (SRT). See [wiki:Commentary/Rts/Storage/GC/CAFs here] for some more detail on CAFs and SRTs. This pass is implemented using Hoopl (see below).

Here the pipeline splits into two alternative flows depending on whether we are splitting proc-points or not. Branches are essentially identical, except that one begins with splitting proc-points, while the other begins with attaching info tables.

'''TODO: Update descriptions below.'''

 * '''Split into multiple !CmmProcs''', implemented in `CmmProcPointZ`.  At this point we build an info-table for each of the !CmmProcs, including SRTs.  Done on the basis of the live local variables (by now mapped to stack slots) and live CAF statics.
   * `LastCall` and `LastReturn` nodes are replaced by `Jump`s.

 * '''Build info tables''', implemented in `CmmBuildInfoTables`..  
   * Find each safe `MidForeignCall` node, "lowers" it into the suspend/call/resume sequence (see `Note [Foreign calls]` in `CmmNode.hs`.), and build an info table for them.
   * Convert the `CmmInfo` for each `CmmProc` into a `[CmmStatic]`, using the live variable information computed just before "Figure out stack layout".
