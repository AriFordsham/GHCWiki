# GHC Commentary: Backends


After [Cmm](commentary/compiler/cmm-type) has been generated, we have a choice of targets to compile to:

- [The C code generator](commentary/compiler/backends/ppr-c)
- [The native code generator](commentary/compiler/backends/ncg)
- [The LLVM code generator](commentary/compiler/backends/llvm)
- [The GHCi code generator](commentary/compiler/backends/gh-ci)


These backends are completely interchangeable. Our preferred route is the native code generator. The C code generator is used for portable, non-optimised, or unregisterised compilation (Note that the LLVM backend also supports building GHC in unregisterised mode as well as registerised mode so it is usually the preferred route for porting GHC).
