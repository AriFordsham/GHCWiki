The long-term plan for reworking GHC's back end is to produce an ``Integrated Code Generator'', which will break down the barrier between the machine-independent code generator (CPS conversion, stack layout, etc) and the native-code generators (instruction selection, calling conventions, register allocation -- including spilling to the C stack, etc). The goal is to simplify the back ends by reducing code duplication and to improve the quality of the generated code by making machine-specific decisions (such as register usage) using knowledge of the actual target machine.

Philosophy

The main infrastructure of the back end may be complicated in some cases, but the  the interface for extending a back end should be as simple as possible. For example, the implementation of the dataflow framework is quite complicated. But we can use the framework to write a new optimization by simply writing down the dataflow transfer functions that are found in standard compiler textbooks. Better yet, we can write combined ``superoptimizations'' with no more effort than writing the dataflow transfer functions for each individual optimization.
