= GHC Commentary: Libraries =

All GHC build trees contain a set of libraries, called the '''Boot Packages'''.  These are the libraries that GHC's source code imports.  Obviously you need the boot packages to build GHC at all (whether the stage-1 or stage-2 compiler).

The Boot Packages, along with the other subcomponents of the GHC build system, are in the file `packages` in a GHC tree. To get a list of them, you can run `make show VALUE=PACKAGES` in a configured GHC build tree.  (This variable is set in `$(TOP)/ghc.mk`.)

Every installation of GHC includes the Boot Packages.

== Zero-boot packages ==

The '''Zero-boot Packages''' are a small subset of the boot packages.  Since GHC's source code imports the boot packages, ''even the bootstrap compiler must have the boot packages available''.  But for certain fast-moving boot packages (eg Cabal), we don't want to rely on the user having installed a bang-up-to-date version of the package.  So we begin the entire build process by installing the zero-boot packages in the bootstrap compiler.  (This installation is purely local to the build tree.)  The bootstrap compiler is expected to have all other (non-zero-) boot packages already installed.

As time goes on, a Zero-boot package may become an ordinary boot package, because the bootstrap compiler is expected to have (a sufficiently up to date) version of the package already.

The current Zero-boot packages are:
 * `Cabal`: we frequently update Cabal and GHC in sync
 * `filepath`

== Classifying the boot packages ==

A second important classification of the boot packages is as follows:

 * '''INDEPENDENT''': Independently maintained (e.g. time, haskeline)
 * '''COUPLED''': Tightly coupled to GHC, but used by others (base)
 * '''SPECIFIC''': Totally specific to GHC (e.g. template-haskell, DPH)

Most boot libraries are INDEPENDENT.  INDEPENDENT libraries have a
master repository somewhere separate from the GHC repositories.  Whenever we release GHC, we ensure that the INDEPENDENT boot libraries that come with GHC are precisely sync'd with a particular released version of that library.

The current classification of packages is:
  * SPECIFIC: `ghc-prim`, `template-haskell`, `DPH`
  * COUPLED: `base`
  * INDEPENDENT: all other packages

== Boot packages dependencies ==

 * At the root of the hierarchy we have '''`ghc-prim`'''. As the name implies, this package contains the most primitive types and functions. It only contains a handful of modules, including `GHC.Prim` (which contains `Int#`, `+#`, etc) and `GHC.Bool`, containing the `Bool` datatype.

 * Above `ghc-prim` is the '''`integer-impl`''' package, where `impl` is one of `gmp` and `simple`, which provides a definition of the `Integer` type (on top of the C `gmp` library, or in plain Haskell, respectively). Which functionality is provided in `ghc-prim` is mostly driven by what functionality the `integer-impl` packages need. By default `integer-gmp` is used; to use `integer-simple` define `INTEGER_LIBRARY=integer-simple` in `mk/build.mk`.

 * Next is the '''`base`''' package. This contains a large number of modules, many of which are in one big cyclic import knot, mostly due to the `Exception` type.

  * On top of base are a number of other, more specialised packages, whose purpose is generally clear from their name. If not, you can get more detail from the descriptions in their Cabal files.  Currently these packages are are:
    * `array`
    * `bytestring`
    * `Cabal`
    * `containers`
    * `directory`
    * `extensible-exceptions`
    * `filepath`
    * `haskeline`
    * `haskell98`
    * `hpc`
    * `mtl`
    * `old-locale`
    * `old-time`
    * `packedstring`
    * `pretty`
    * `process`
    * `random`
    * `syb`
    * `template-haskell`
    * `terminfo`
    * `unix`
    * `utf8-string`
    * `Win32`
The `haskell98`, `old-time` and `random` packages are mostly only needed for Haskell 98 support, although `dph` currently uses `random` too.
