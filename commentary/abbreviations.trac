= GHC Source Code Abbreviations =

Certain abbreviations are used pervasively throughout the GHC source code. This page gives a partial list of them and their expansion:

* '''ANF''': A-normal form

* '''BCO''': Byte-code object

* '''CAF''': Constant Applicative Form

* '''Class''': Type Class

* '''Cmm''': The final IR used in GHC, based on the C-- language

* '''Core''': GHC core language. Based on System FC (variant of System F). Represents a type-checked and desugared program in some (out of several) intermediate compilation step

* '''CoreFV''': Free variables in core

* '''!CoreLint''': Type and sanity-checking of core. (Lint: Jargon for a program analysis that looks for bug-suspicious code.)

* '''!CoreSubst''': Substitution in core

* '''!CoreSyn''': Core abstract syntax

* '''!DataCon''': Data constructor

* '''Ds''': Desugarer

* '''Gbl''': Global

* '''Hs''': Haskell Syntax (generally as opposed to Core, for example, Expr vs !HsExpr)

* '''Hsc''': Haskell compiler. Means it Deals with compiling a single module and no more.

* '''!HsSyn''': Haskell abstract syntax

* '''Id''': Synonym for Var, but indicating a term variable

* '''Iface''': Interface, as in Haskell interface (.hi) files

* '''!IfaceSyn''': Interface abstract syntax

* '''LHs''': Located Haskell something

* '''Loc''': Location, as in !SrcLoc

* '''Located''': Something annotated with a !SrcSpan

* '''Lcl''': Local

* '''nativeGen''': Native code generator (generates assembly from Cmm)

* '''Occ''': Occurrence
  * However, in the context of [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/RdrNameType#TheOccNametype OccName], "occurrence" actually means "classified (i.e. as a type name, value name, etc) but not qualified and not yet resolved"

* '''PId''': Package ID

* '''!PprCore''': Pretty-printing core

* '''Rdr''': Parser (or reader)

* '''Rn''': Rename or Renamer

* '''Rts''': Run Time System

* '''!SimplCore''': Simplify core (the so-called simplifier belongs to this, as does the strictness analyser)

* '''!SrcLoc''': Source location (filename, line number, character position)

* '''!SrcSpan''': Source location span (filename, start line number and character position, end line number and character position)

* '''STG''': [Commentary/Compiler/StgSynType Spineless Tagless G-machine]

* '''Tc''': !TypeCheck{ing,er}

* '''TSO''': [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Rts/Storage/HeapObjects#ThreadStateObjects Thread State Object]

* '''!TyCon''': Type constructor

* '''!TyThing''': Something that is type-checkable

* '''Ty''': Type

* '''!TyVar''': Synonym for Var, but indicating a type variable

* '''Var''': A variable with some information about its type (or kind)
