Certain abbreviations are used pervasively throughout the GHC source code.  A few, like "Tc", are easy to figure out.  Others, like "Occ", are more challenging (in case you were wondering, none of GHC's code is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult Occult], except perhaps in the Latin sense)

See also: [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/List_of_abbreviations A similar list on the GHC Users' wiki].

* "Occ" means "Occurrence"
  * However, in the context of [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/RdrNameType#TheOccNametype OccName], "occurrence" actually means "unqualified"

* "Rn" means "Renamer"

* "Rdr" means ??? (help, somebody fill this in, I still have no idea what it stands for)

* "Tc" means "TypeCheck{ing,er}"

* "Lcl" means "Local"

* "Gbl" means "Global"

* "Loc" means "Location", as in SrcLoc

* "Hs" means "Haskell Syntax" (generally as opposed to Core -- for example, Expr vs HsExpr)
