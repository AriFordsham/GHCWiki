Certain abbreviations are used pervasively throughout the GHC source code.  A few, like "Tc", are easy to figure out.  Others, like "Occ", are more challenging (in case you were wondering, none of GHC's code is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult Occult])

* "Occ" means "Occurrence"

* "Rn" means "Renamer"

* "Rdr" means ??? (help, somebody fill this in, I still have no idea what it stands for)

* "Tc" means "TypeCheck{ing,er}"

* "Lcl" means "Local"

* "Gbl" means "Global"
