
== General Plan ==

The idea is to identify installed packages by a hash of the information needed to build them.
This hash is the new InstalledPackageId.
The new installation directory for each instance is $libdir/$pkgid/$installedpackageid.
The hash is computed during installation in installLib as well as during registration in generateRegistrationInfo.

== Information used to compute the hash ==

== Details ==

The ABI hash becomes a field of InstalledPackageInfo. (What is it needed for?)

For inplace package registration any packages with the same location must be unregistered.

== Open Questions ==

Executables?
Haddock?
Garbage Collection?
Installation Planner?
