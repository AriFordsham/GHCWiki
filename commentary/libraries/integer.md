# GHC Commentary: [Libraries/Integer](commentary/libraries/integer)


GHC is set up to allow different implementations of the `Integer` type to be chosen at build time.

## Selecting an Integer implementation


You can select which implementation of Integer is used by defining `INTEGER_LIBRARY` in `mk/build.mk`. This tells the build system to build the library in `libraries/$(INTEGER_LIBRARY)`, and the `cIntegerLibrary` and `cIntegerLibraryType` values in `Config.hs` are defined accordingly.


The default value is `integer-gmp`, which uses the [ GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)](http://gmplib.org/) to define the Integer type and its operations.


The other implementation currently available is `integer-simple`, which uses a simple (but slow, for larger Integers) pure Haskell implementation.

## The Integer interface


All Integer implementations should export the same set of types and functions from `GHC.Integer` (within whatever `integer` package you are using). These exports are used by the `base` package However, all of these types and functions must actually be defined in `GHC.Integer.Type`, so that GHC knows where to find them.

## How Integer is handled inside GHC

- **Front end**.  Integers are represented using the `HsInteger` constructor of `HsLit` for the early phases of compilation (e.g. type checking)

- **Core**.  In `Core` representation, an integer literal is represented by the LitInteger` constructor of the `Literal\` type. 

  ```wiki
  data Literal = ... | LitInteger Integer Type
  ```

  While `Integer`s aren't "machine literals" like the other `Core``Literal` constructors, it is more convenient when writing constant folding RULES to pretend that they are literals rather than having to understand their concrete representation. (Especially as the concrete representation varies from package to package.) We also carry around a `Type`, representing the `Integer` type, in the constructor, as we need access to it in a few functions (e.g. `literalType`).

- **Constant folding**.  There are many constant-folding optimisations for `Integer` expressed as built-in rules in [compiler/prelude/PrelRules.lhs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/prelude/PrelRules.lhs); look at `builtinIntegerRules`.  All of the types and functions in the `Integer` interface have built-in names, e.g. `plusIntegerName`, defined in [compiler/prelude/PrelNames.lhs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/prelude/PrelNames.lhs) and included in `basicKnownKeyNames`. This allows us to match on all of the functions in `builtinIntegerRules` in [compiler/prelude/PrelRules.lhs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/prelude/PrelRules.lhs), so we can constant-fold Integer expressions.

- **Representing integers**.  We stick to the `LitInteger` representation (which hides the concrete representation) as late as possible in the compiler.   In particular, it's important that this representation is used in unfoldings in interface files, so that constant folding can happen on expressions that get inlined.  We finally convert `LitInteger` to a proper core representation of Integer in [compiler/coreSyn/CorePrep.lhs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/coreSyn/CorePrep.lhs), which looks up the Id for `mkInteger` and uses it to build an expression like `mkInteger True [123, 456]` (where the `Bool` represents the sign, and the list of `Int`s are 31 bit chunks of the absolute value from lowest to highest).

- **Don't inline integer functions**.  Most of the functions in the Integer implementation in the `integer` package are marked `NOINLINE`. For example in `integer-gmp` we have

  ```wiki
  plusInteger :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
  plusInteger (S# i1) (S# i2) = ...
  plusInteger (S# i1) (J# j1 j2) = ...
  ...two more cases...
  ```

  Not only is this a big function to inline, but inlining it typically does no good because the representation of literals is abstact, so no pattern-matching cancellation happens.  And even if you have `(a+b+c)`, the conditionals mean that no cancellation happens, or you get an exponential code explosion!
