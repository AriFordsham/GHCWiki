(the plan is to rename this page to something like "intro to typechecker plugins" once it's ready)

# What typechecker plugins can do
## Example tasks which are possible
## Example type-related tasks which are not
## What info the plugin has access to
### Constraints
### Evidence
### Definitions in other files
# Basics
## The Plugin type
## Invoking a plugin

# Examples
## How to teach the solver about e.g. arithmetic facts

## How to implement magic typeclasses
## How to implement magic nullary constraints

# Background knowledge
## Typeclass constraints
## Equality constraints
## Quantified constraints
## Evidence
