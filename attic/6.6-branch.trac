Would push the following changes:
Fri Sep 29 23:57:51 BST 2006  sof@galois.com
  * rejig library include/ files

Sun Oct  1 02:12:02 BST 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * MERGE: Improve unification error messages (again) (push to 6.6 branch)

Mon Oct  9 15:04:37 BST 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * Set version number to 6.6

Tue Oct 10 09:48:33 BST 2006  Simon Marlow <simonmar@microsoft.com>
  * fix broken <link> element, preventing the User's Guide from building

Wed Oct 11 13:47:40 BST 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  tagged 6.6 release

Thu Oct 12 13:13:21 BST 2006  sven.panne@aedion.de
  * Track changes in source packaging scheme

Thu Oct 12 15:22:44 BST 2006  Simon Marlow <simonmar@microsoft.com>
  * Build the GHC package in stage 3 too
  This fixes the problem with the nightly builds not including the GHC
  package.

Mon Oct 16 11:44:11 BST 2006  Simon Marlow <simonmar@microsoft.com>
  * Fix deadlock on second call to newSession
  Tracked down by Krasimir Angelov

Mon Oct 16 12:16:30 BST 2006  Simon Marlow <simonmar@microsoft.com>
  * oops, I committed a broken version of "Fix deadlock on second call..."

Wed Oct 18 10:36:58 BST 2006  simonpj@microsoft.com
  * Fix loop in GADT type refinement

  Finding the in-scope set when building the GADT type refinement
  was bogusly using the result of the fixpoint.  Only shows up
  when forall'd types are involved (else the in-scope set isn't
  consulted).

  Test is tc214 (on the HEAD).  This fix is to the 6.6 branch, because
  the HEAD is ok.

  Fixes Trac #940.


Fri Oct 20 16:39:25 BST 2006  Simon Marlow <simonmar@microsoft.com>
  * In hashExpr, use Word32 rather than relying on wrapping behaviour of Int
  Fixes #952, as it turns out.

  When compiling via C, we are at the mercy of C's undefined behaviour
  with respect to overflow of signed integer operations, and this was
  biting us here.

  Perhaps we should always add the -fwrapv flag to gcc, but since
  Haskell doesn't define overflow on Int either, it seemed the right
  thing to do to fix this code anyway.

Sat Nov 11 14:15:31 GMT 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * MERGE: Figure out where the rest of the repositories are, based on defaultrepo

Wed Nov 15 00:55:51 GMT 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * MERGE: Fix error reporting for contexts during deriving (Trac 958)
   simonpj@microsoft.com**20061101122120

   When doing the fixpoint iteration for 'deriving' we have to be careful
   not to end up in a loop, even if we have -fallow-undecidable-instances.

   Test is tcfail169

Wed Nov 15 01:53:00 GMT 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * Fix compilation problems

Wed Nov 15 13:50:20 GMT 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * MERGE: Fix (yet another) odd interaction between selector thunks and compacting GC
    Tue Nov 14 12:31:57 GMT 2006  Simon Marlow <simonmar@microsoft.com>
    * Fix (yet another) odd interaction between selector thunks and compacting GC
    This should fix errors of the form

      internal error: scavenge_mark_stack: unimplemented/strange closure
        type 28 @ 0x2b92e5f79960

    But since it's quite difficult to reproduce the error, I can't be 100%
    certain it's gone.  I certainly can't reproduce it again after the
    fix, anyway.

Mon Nov 20 12:18:55 GMT 2006  Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>
  * MERGE: Don't make ghc threaded if GhcNotThreaded is YES

Thu Nov 23 12:55:39 GMT 2006  Thorkil Naur <naur@post11.tele.dk>
  * Fix darcs-all for Mac OS X

  The regular exporession /\? which is used by darcs-all to stand for zero or one /'s
  seems to be a GNU extension of "basic" regular expressions. In any case, it is not
  supported by sed on Mac OS X 10.4.

  The patched darcs-all works on Max OS X and (SuSE) Linux.
