# FreeBSD Support for GHC

## Versions Supported


FreeBSD 8.x and 9.x on both `i386` (x86) and `amd64` (x86_64) are fully supported, support for 10.x is in progress, one may experience problems.

## Building on FreeBSD


Build instructions for FreeBSD are incorporated in the [Building Guide](building).  In particular, here is how to [set up your FreeBSD system for building GHC](building/preparation/free-bsd).

## Installing on FreeBSD


The recommend way to install GHC on FreeBSD is just to install it as part of the Haskell Platform port, i.e. [devel/hs-haskell-platform](http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-haskell-platform).  This can be done via old pkg_tools:

```wiki
# pkg_add -r hs-haskell-platform
```


Or via pkg:

```wiki
# pkg install hs-haskell-platform
```


Note that you can find ports for many popular Haskell software on FreeBSD.  For the complete listing, please consult [the haskell category](http://www.freshports.org/haskell) in the Ports Collection.


An experimental developer repository can be also found on [GitHub](https://github.com/freebsd-haskell/freebsd-haskell) and you read more about the FreeBSD status on its [FreeBSD wiki page](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Haskell).
