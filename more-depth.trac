= Areas We'd Like To See Covered In More Depth =

 * The build system (for example)
 * How does this Cabal thing work?
 * How to read a dailysnapshot build log.
 * Does ghc compile with VisualHaskell yet?
 * In the compiler pipeline, please explain a little more about the invariants as a program flows through the pipeline.  For example, toward the back end, it would be useful to know at what point the following become known:
   * layout of heap objects
   * explicit heap pointer (allocation pointer)
   * explicit stack pointer
