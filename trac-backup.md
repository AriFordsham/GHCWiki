# Trac Backup


Trac backups are simply a copied snapshot of the entire [project environment](trac-environment) directory, including the database. Backups can be created using the `hotcopy` command in [trac-admin](trac-admin).

**Note**: Trac uses the `hotcopy` nomenclature to match that of [ Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), to make it easier to remember when managing both Trac and Subversion servers.

## Creating a Backup


To create a backup of a live [TracEnvironment](trac-environment) simply run:

```
$ trac-admin /path/to/projenv hotcopy /path/to/backupdir
```

[trac-admin](trac-admin) will lock the database while copying.


The resulting backup directory is safe to handle using standard file-based backup tools like `tar` or `dump`/`restore`.


Please note, the `hotcopy` command will not overwrite a target directory and when such exists, the operation ends with an error: `Command failed: [Errno 17] File exists:` This is discussed in [ \#3198](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/ticket%3A3198).

## Restoring a Backup


To restore an environment from a backup, stop the process running Trac, ie the Web server or [tracd](trac-standalone), restore the contents of your backup (path/to/backupdir) to your [project environment](trac-environment) directory and restart the service.


To restore a PostgreSQL database backup, use the command:

```
psql -U <user> -d <database> -f postgresql.dump
```


The `<database>` option is the same as the [database connection string](trac-environment#database-connection-strings) in the `[trac]` `database` option of *trac.ini*.
