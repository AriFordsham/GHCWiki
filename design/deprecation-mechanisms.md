# Interface deprecation mechanisms


This page serves as a place to collect proposals, tickets, open problems, and ideas regarding mechanisms for deprecating program interfaces.


For motivation for these mechanisms one can look to a number of recently-considered proposals for reworking the core libraries, for instance the [ Applicative-Monad Proposal](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor-Applicative-Monad_Proposal#Future-proofing_current_code).

## Warning on import of `DEPRECATED` definitions


GHC has for a long time allowed users to attach `DEPRECATED` pragmas to definitions, defining a warning message which will be shown to clients when a use-site of the marked definition is encountered.


Sadly, this design doesn't account for instances where a deprecated definition is explicitly imported but not actually *used*. [\#2119](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/2119) argues that GHC should issue a warning when an explicit import of a deprecated definition is found.

TODO Write formal specification.

## Deprecating exports


GHC's existing `DEPRECATED` pragma only covers definitions, not their visibility. [\#4879](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/4879) argues that GHC should allow `DEPRECATED` pragmas to be attached to names in export lists, meaning that the definition itself isn't deprecated (allowing warning-free uses within the defining module), only its role as an outward-facing interface.

## Class method deprecation


As of GHC 7.10 there is no effective way to demote a typeclass method to a normal top-level binding (see [\#10071](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/10071)). This would be useful in cases such as

- removing the `return` method from `Monad` as proposed by the [ Monad of No Return proposal](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2015-September/026121.html)
- removing the `mappend` method from `Monoid` as proposed in [Proposal/SemigroupMonoid](proposal/semigroup-monoid)


A concrete proposal for allowing `DEPRECATED` pragmas to be attached to class methods can be found at [Design/DeprecationMechanisms/TypeClassMethods](design/deprecation-mechanisms/type-class-methods).

## `REMOVED` Pragma


Once a method or function is finally removed, we just get a compiler error which doesn't give much guidance what to use instead. A suggestion is to have a `REMOVED` pragma into which a `DEPRECATED` pragma can be rewritten into, providing additional guidance for a missing symbol that was once there.


Possible extension for removed class `method`s: When defining a no-more existent `method` as part of an instance definition, ignore definitions matching a set of specified implementation bodies. E.g. for AMP defining `return = pure` even though `return` has been `REMOVED` could be tolerated. This would allow for a CPP-less transition.
