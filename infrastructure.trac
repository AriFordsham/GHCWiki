There are a number of services and tools that GHC developers should be aware of.

== Official tools ==

 * Our [[Repositories|git repositories]], which are best used following the [[https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/|Working Conventions]]
 * The trac instance you are just using, which hosts the [[/wiki|wiki]] and the [[/report|bug tracker]]
 * Our [[MailingListsAndIRC|mailing lists]]
 * For code review, we use a [[Phabricator]] instance at https://phabricator.haskell.org/
 * We use [[Travis]] to validate each new commit: see https://travis-ci.org/ghc/ghc/builds for the current status
 * We also validate new commits using [[Phabricator/Harbormaster|Harbormaster]]: see https://phabricator.haskell.org/diffusion/GHC/history/ for the current status
 * The evolution of the performance of our master branch is tracked on http://perf.haskell.org/ghc
 * We also use dedicated [wiki:Builder builders] to do nightly [[http://haskell.inf.elte.hu/builders/|builds]] of GHC and the [[http://haskell.inf.elte.hu/docs/|user documentation]]. See the [[wiki:BuilderSummary| builder summary page]] for more information. 

== External tools ==

There are a bunch of external services that might be of interest to GHC developers:

 * Source code statistics on Ohloh: https://www.ohloh.net/p/ghc
 * Similar statistics, on GitHub: https://github.com/ghc/ghc/graphs
