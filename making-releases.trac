= Making Releases =

== Branching the tree ==

Make a `ghc-x.y` branch of all of the repos (including those with a 'dph' tag). In the ghc branch, change `sync-all` so that it doesn't get the `dph` repos by default, and change `validate` so that it doesn't require them to be present.

For repos with an upstream maintainer, ask upstream what commit we should be using in the branch.

Update http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Repositories#Branches

== Make release notes ==

In `docs/users_guide`, add a `$VERSION-notes.xml` file and write the release notes.

Add a corresponding `relnotes$PATCH_LEVEL` entity to `ug-ent.xml.in`, and use the entity at the end of the chapter in `intro.xml`.

== Updating the tree ==

Update the `ANNOUNCE` file in the root of the tree.

In the `AC_INIT` line of `configure.ac`, set the version number. A few lines below, set `RELEASE=YES`.

== Making the source tarball ==

The source tarball includes some generated files, such as `Parser.hs` (generated from `Parser.y.pp`). We therefore need to do a build before generating the source tarball.

First [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources#Gettingabranch check out the branch], and ensure that the version number and `RELEASE` near the top of `configure.ac` are correct. Then:

{{{
$ perl boot
$ ./configure
$ make         # GHC <= 7.10 only
$ make sdist
}}}

It is advisable to use a machine with as recent an `autoreconf` as possible; in particular, 2.61 is known to make a configure script that doesn't work on Windows.

You should now have source tarballs `sdistprep/ghc-<VERSION>-src.tar.bz2` and `sdistprep/ghc-<VERSION>-testsuite.tar.bz2`.

== Making the binary builds ==

First, you should make sure your environment has all of the tools necessary to make a proper release build.  This can include more tools than an "ordinary" build of GHC requires, since documentation requires extra tools.  You will need:

 * dblatex
 * HsColour (cabal install hscolour)
 * docbook-xsl (otherwise you will get error `failed to load external entity "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/html/chunk.xsl"`)

A good sanity check is to check the output of `configure` and make sure all of the tool fields are filled out.

Untar the `src` tarball. Then:
{{{
$ cat > mk/build.mk <<EOF
V=1
HADDOCK_DOCS=YES
LATEX_DOCS=YES
HSCOLOUR_SRCS=YES
BUILD_DOCBOOK_HTML=YES
BUILD_DOCBOOK_PDF=YES
BUILD_DOCBOOK_PS=YES
BeConservative=YES
EOF
}}}

(Note that `BeConservative` is only relevant on Linux, as it controls usage of `clock_gettime` in the RTS.)

Then:
{{{
$ ./configure      2>&1 | tee ../conf.log
$ make             2>&1 | tee ../make.log
$ make binary-dist 2>&1 | tee ../bd.log
}}}

Nightly builders will automatically produce release builds on FreeBSD, putting the results [http://haskell.inf.elte.hu/ghc/dist/freebsd8/ here].

== Sanity checking the binary builds ==

The `compare` tool compares the tarballs of different releases, and warns about possible problems:

{{{
$ cd <</path/to/ghc/tree>>/distrib/compare
$ make
}}}

{{{
$ <</path/to/ghc/tree>>/distrib/compare/compare <<previous_release_files>> <<this_release_files>>
}}}

== Check that the build can build the release ==

Install the release, set your `$PATH`, then just untar and:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
}}}

== Create and upload the library documentation ==

{{{
haskell.org$ mkdir /srv/web/haskell.org/ghc/docs/<<VERSION>>
}}}

{{{
$ <</path/to/ghc/tree>>/distrib/mkDocs/mkDocs ghc-*-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 ghc-*-i386-unknown-mingw32.tar.bz2
$ cd docs
$ scp * haskell.org:/srv/web/haskell.org/ghc/docs/<<VERSION>>
}}}

{{{
haskell.org$ cd /srv/web/haskell.org/ghc/docs/<<VERSION>>
haskell.org$ mkdir html
haskell.org$ cd html
haskell.org$ mv ../index.html .
haskell.org$ for i in ../*.tar.bz2; do tar -jxf $i; done
}}}

Sanity check `http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/<<VERSION>>/`. In particular, check that the libraries docs include both Win32 and unix.

== Prepare the webpage ==

In the `http://www.haskell.org/ghc` darcs repository, create a `download_ghc_<<MANGLED_VERSION>>.shtml` page based on the previous one.

Sanity check `http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_<<MANGLED_VERSION>>`. In particular, check that the release notes and documentation links work.

== Upload the binaries ==

{{{
scp -r 7.6.2 haskell.org:/srv/web/haskell.org/ghc/dist/
}}}

Sanity check that the download links work.

== Announcing ==

Add the release to "Versions" in the trac admin section, and make it the default version.

Update "Current Stable Release" in `download.shtml`, and move the previous release down to "Older Releases".

Update "Latest News" in `index.shtml`.

{{{
haskell.org$ ~/mk-latest-links
haskell.org$ ~/mk-latest-links | sh
}}}

Mail `ANNOUNCE` to `glasgow-haskell-users@haskell.org, haskell@haskell.org`, subject `ANNOUNCE: GHC version <<VERSION>>`.

For an RC, a smaller message is sent to just `glasgow-haskell-users@haskell.org`, e.g.:
{{{
Subject: ANNOUNCE: GHC x.y.z Release Candidate 1

We are pleased to announce the first release candidate for GHC x.y.z:

    http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/x.y.z-rc1/

This includes the source tarball and bindists for Windows, Linux, OS X and FreeBSD, on x86 and x86_64.

We plan to make the x.y.z release <sometime>.

Please test as much as possible; bugs are much cheaper if we find them
before the release!
}}}

== Uploading libraries ==

TODO FIXME: Normally Herbert and upstream maintainers take care of this - we always attempt to have full releases for all package by the time the final release happens (although not necessarily so for an RC - they may ship slight interim states).

Heuristic for detecting submodule libraries which have no proper release:

{{{
$ git submodule  | grep -F -- '-g'

}}}

The listing above shows submodules which point to submodules that have no *annotated* tag, and which need further investigation. In some cases the tag just wasn't propagated from the upstream repo into our local Git mirror.
