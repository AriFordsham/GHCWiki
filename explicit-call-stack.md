# Maintaining an explicit call stack


There has been a vigorous thread on error attribution ("I get a `head []` error; but who called `head`?").  This page summarises various approaches.

## Background

- [\#1441](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/1441), [\#960](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/960), [\#9049](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/9049) which would be fixed by this.
- [ Simon Hengel's "rewrite with location" proposal](https://github.com/sol/rewrite-with-location), see also [ Michael Snoyman's post](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2013-February/106617.html)

## Approaches


Here are the approaches we have under consideration

- **(PROF) Use profiling**.  Almost all the same issues arise in answering the question "where should I attribute this allocation cost?" as arise when answering "where did this error arise"?  If you

  - Compile with profiling
  - Run with `+RTS -xc`

> then any crash (call to `error`) will yield an informative backtrace.  The backtrace gives you a stack of calls that looks very like what you'd get in a call-by-value language.  (Lots of papers about profiling in a lazy language, dating right back to \[[ http://research.microsoft.com/\~simonpj/papers/1997_profiling_TOPLAS.ps.gz](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/1997_profiling_TOPLAS.ps.gz) Formally based profiling for higher order functional languages) give the background.

- **(DYN) Walk the call stack, generating a dynamic backtrace.**  This is what every other language does; it works in a production system (ie all debug flags off); and it carries zero runtime overhead unless a crash actually happens.

- **(NEEDLE) Finding the needle**.  This is a cross between (PROF) and (DYN).  It transforms the program, but in a less invasive way than for full profiling.  Lots more details on [ExplicitCallStack/FindingTheNeedle](explicit-call-stack/finding-the-needle).  We don't currently plan to implement this in HEAD: it is not clear that, given (PROF) and (DYN), it's worth a third path, and one that is non-trivial to implement (as you'll see from the paper).

- **(IMPLICIT)** Implicit locations.  Currently (May 2014) I'm just floating this idea: [ExplicitCallStack/ImplicitLocations](explicit-call-stack/implicit-locations).  Its main merit is its extreme simplicity.
