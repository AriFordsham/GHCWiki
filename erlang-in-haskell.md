## Cloud Haskell


Cloud Haskell is a distributed computing framework for Haskell, implemented in Haskell. It's a tool for writing applications that coordinate their work on a cluster of commodity computers or virtual machines. This is useful for providing highly reliable, redundant, long-running services, as well as for building compute-intensive applications that can benefit from lots of hardware. It has two interfaces:

- The *process layer* (aka [ErlangInHaskell](erlang-in-haskell)): an interface based on message-passing between distributed processes.
- The *task layer* (aka SkywritingInHaskell): a fault-tolerant data-centric interface.
