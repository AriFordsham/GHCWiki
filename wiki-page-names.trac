= Wiki Page Names
[[TracGuideToc]]

Wiki page names commonly use the CamelCase convention. Within wiki text, any word in CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that name.

CamelCase page names follow these rules:

 1. The name must consist of '''alphabetic characters only'''; no digits, spaces, punctuation or underscores are allowed.
 1. A name must have at least two capital letters.
 1. The first character must be capitalized.
 1. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
 1. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted in page names, where it typically represents a hierarchy.

If you want to create a wiki page that does not follow CamelCase rules. you can use the following syntax:
{{{
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],
   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"]
   and with a label: [wiki:"Space Matters" all about white space]
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s
 * even better, the [[WikiCreole link style]]
   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]
}}}

This will be rendered as:
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],
   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"] ''(that page name embeds space characters)''
   and with a label: [wiki:"Space Matters" all about white space]
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s
 * even better, the [[WikiCreole link style]]
   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]

It is possible to link to a specific ''version'' of a Wiki page as you would do for a specific version of a file, for example: WikiStart@1.

You can prevent a !CamelCase name from being interpreted as a [TracLinks link] by quoting it with an exclamation mark: `!CamelCase`. See TracLinks#EscapingLinks.

As in the example above, you can append an anchor to a Wiki page name to link to a specific section within that page. The anchor can be seen by hovering the mouse over a section heading, then clicking on the [[html(&para;)]] sign that appears at its end. The anchor is usually generated automatically, but it is also possible to specify it explicitly: see WikiFormatting#using-explicit-id-in-heading.

There are a few options that govern the rendering of WikiPageNames:
* CamelCase linking to missing pages can be disabled with the `ignore_missing_pages` [https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracIni#wiki-section option]. Linking to missing pages is enabled by default.
* The `split_page_names` option, when enabled, will split CamelCase words when rendering a link. For example, WikiStart will be rendered as [WikiStart Wiki Start].
