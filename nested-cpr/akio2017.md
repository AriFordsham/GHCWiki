This page tracks \@akio's attempt at reviving \@nomeata's work on [NestedCPR](nested-cpr).


Latest code can be found at [ https://github.com/takano-akio/ghc/compare/master...nested-cpr](https://github.com/takano-akio/ghc/compare/master...nested-cpr) .

## Examples

### simple.hs


This is a simple recursive function with an easy-to-spot nested CPR property.


Status: ok

```
moduleFoowheref::Int->(Int,Int)f0=(1,2)f n
  | even n = f (div n 2)| otherwise =case f (n -1)of(a, b)->(a -1, b)
```

### strictness.hs


This one is trickier in that the analysis has to use the nested strictness of `foo` on `p` to give `p` a nested CPR property. Inspired by `nofib/imaginary/x2n1`.


Status: ok

```
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}moduleFoowherefoo::Int->(Int,Int)->(Int,Int)foo n p
  | even (n + uncurry (+) p), n /=0= foo (n -1) p
  | n ==0=(1,2)| otherwise = p
```
