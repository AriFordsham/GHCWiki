This page tracks \@akio's attempt at reviving \@nomeata's work on [NestedCPR](nested-cpr).


Latest code can be found at [ https://github.com/takano-akio/ghc/compare/master...nested-cpr](https://github.com/takano-akio/ghc/compare/master...nested-cpr) .

## Examples

### simple.hs


This is a simple recursive function with an easy-to-spot nested CPR property.


Status: ok

```
moduleFoowheref::Int->(Int,Int)f0=(1,2)f n
  | even n = f (div n 2)| otherwise =case f (n -1)of(a, b)->(a -1, b)
```

### strictness.hs


This one is trickier in that the analysis has to use the nested strictness of `foo` on `p` to give `p` a nested CPR property. Inspired by `nofib/imaginary/x2n1`.


Status: ok

```
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}moduleFoowherefoo::Int->(Int,Int)->(Int,Int)foo n p
  | even (n + uncurry (+) p), n /=0= foo (n -1) p
  | n ==0=(1,2)| otherwise = p
```

### strict_field.hs


This one needs a correct handling of strict constructor fields. Inspired by `nofib/imaginary/x2n1`.


Status: ok

```
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}moduleFoowheredataC a =C!a !a

pow::CDouble->Int->CDoublepow!_0=C01pow!c 1= c
pow c n
  | even n =let d = pow c (div n 2)in mul d d
  | otherwise = mul c (pow c (n -1))mul::CDouble->CDouble->CDoublemul(C a b)(C d e)=C(a*d-b*e)(a*e+b*d)
```

### strict_field1.hs


This is similar to `strict_field.hs`, but needs a more aggressive worker-wrapper.


Status: not ok. Currently the worker has the type `Double -> Double -> Int# -> (# Double, Double #)`, rather than the desired `Double# -> Double# -> Int# -> (# Double#, Double# #)`.


Changing CPR analysis alone wouldn't help here. We need to give the function a better strictness as well.

```
moduleFoo(pow)wheredataC a =C!a !a

pow::CDouble->Int->CDoublepow x y
  | even y    = pow (x `mul` x)(y `quot`2)| y ==1= x
  | otherwise = pow (x `mul` x)((y -1)`quot`2)`mul` x

mul::CDouble->CDouble->CDoublemul(C a b)(C d e)=C(a*d-b*e)(a*e+b*d)
```

### peek.hs


This example involves reading a tuple if Ints from memory.


Status: needs -fcpr-depth=4 or higher.

```
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}moduleFoo(peek4)whereimportForeign.StorableimportForeign.Ptrpeek4::PtrInt->PtrInt->(PtrInt->IO(PtrInt,PtrInt))->IO(PtrInt,PtrInt,(Int,Int,Int,Int))peek4 ptr end req
  | end `minusPtr` ptr >=32=do
      val <-(,,,)<$> peekByteOff ptr 0<*> peekByteOff ptr 8<*> peekByteOff ptr 16<*> peekByteOff ptr 24let!ptr' = ptr `plusPtr`32
      return (ptr', end, val)| otherwise =do(ptr', end')<- req ptr
      peek4 ptr' end' req
```
