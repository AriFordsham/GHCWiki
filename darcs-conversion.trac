= Converting from Darcs =

== Conversion status ===

Done:

 * `.darcs-boring` -> `.gitignore'

== Dependencies on darcs ==

The following is intended to be a complete list of the things that would need to change if we were to switch away from darcs, in addition to the conversion of the repository itself, which I am assuming can be automatically converted using available tools.

The following code/scripts would need to be adapted or replaced:

 * The `darcs-all` script
 * The `push-all` script
 * The `aclocal.m4` code that attempts to determine the source tree date
 * `.darcs-boring`
 * The buildbot scripts
 * checkin email script: `/home/darcs/bin/commit-messages-split.sh`
 * Trac integration (the GHC Trac does not currently integrate with darcs, however)
 * darcsweb (use whatever alternative is available)

The following documentation would need to change:

 * `README`
 * [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources]
 * [wiki:Building/Windows]
 * [wiki:Building/QuickStart]
 * [wiki:Building/Rebuilding]
 * [wiki:Building/RunningNoFib]
 * [wiki:DarcsRepositories] (inc. the sidebar)

 * [wiki:WorkingConventions/FixingBugs]
