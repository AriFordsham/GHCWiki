# Parallel Hacker Meetings

## What's it?


This is a series of informal meetings of people actively working on parallel Haskell
implementations, mainly GpH and Eden. Physically these meetings involve mainly people
from Heriot-Watt and St Andrews Univ, with others joining in over Skype.

## Meetings

### March 8th, 2010


Where: EM 1.58 (Mountbatten building), Heriot-Watt Univ, Edinburgh  [ Web Map](http://www.hw.ac.uk/maps/detailed-campus-map.pdf)

- Strategic discussion on GpH:

  - Community support (Book, strategies module etc)
  - Visibility (Web pages, tutorial etc)
  - Project integration (Current and future projects)
  - Define focus for future developments: 

    - Pick your top 3 tools etc that would help your research
    - Pick your top 3 challenge applications [ SICSA Multi-core Challenge](http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/news/sicsa-multicore-challenge)
    - Pick your top 3 arguments why a Fortran programmer should switch to Haskell
- Technical discussion on GpH:

  - Updates on GpH/Eden sub-tasks (see [ GpHEden Wiki](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/GpHEden))
  - Status reports on GpH-related hacking
  - Discussions on:

    - Application-level abstractions for parallelism
    - Language-level primitives for controlling parallelism
    - RTS-level implementation
- Future directions:

  - Next steps in Eden/GUM integration
  - Roadmap towards serialisation integration
  - Future mtgs
