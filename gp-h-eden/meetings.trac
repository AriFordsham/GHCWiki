== What's it? ==

This is a series of informal meetings of people actively working on parallel Haskell
implementations, mainly GpH and Eden. Physically these meetings involve mainly people
from Heriot-Watt and St Andrews Univ, with others joining in over Skype.

Where: EM 1.58 (Mountbatten building), Heriot-Watt Univ, Edinburgh

When:  1:30 - 4:00 pm, March 8th, 2010.

Agenda for the GpH/Eden mtg March 8th, 2010.
This intentionally gives only a rough structure for the discussions at the mtg:

 * Strategic discussion on GpH:
  * Community support (Book, strategies module etc)
  * Visibility (Web pages, tutorial etc)
  * Project integration (Current and future projects)
  * Define focus for future developments: 
    * Pick your top 3 tools etc that would help your research
    * Pick your top 3 challenge applications
    * Pick your top 3 arguments why a Fortran programmer should switch to Haskell
 * Technical discussion on GpH:
  * Updates on GpH/Eden sub-tasks (see [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/GpHEden GpHEden Wiki])
  * Status reports on GpH-related hacking
  * Discussions on:
    * Application-level abstractions for parallelism
    * Language-level primitives for controlling parallelism
    * RTS-level implementation
 * Future directions:
  * Next steps in Eden/GUM integration
  * Roadmap towards serialisation integration
  * Future mtgs
