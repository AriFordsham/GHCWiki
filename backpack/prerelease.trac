== Examples ==
=== Hello World ===

To test that everything is working properly, create the following two files:

{{{
-- hello.bkp
executable hello where
  includes: base
  main-is: hello

-- hello.hs
main = putStrLn "Hello world!"
}}}

and then compile with:

{{{
ghc --backpack hello.bkp
./hello
-- Hello world!
}}}

=== Reusable import lists ===

Suppose you have a Haskell file with an import `import System.Directory (doesFileExist)`; you're using an explicit import list because that's good style, or you don't want to accidentally use a new function that's not available on all versions of the package you care about.  You now want to reuse this import list in another module, but you don't want to copy it over. Here's an example of how to do this in Backpack:

{{{
-- importlist.bkp
package directory-sigs where
    includes: base, time
    exposed-signatures: System.Directory

package p where
    includes: base, directory-sigs
    exposed-modules: P Q

executable Main where
    includes: base, directory, p
    main-is: Main

-- directory-sigs/System/Directory.hsig
module System.Directory where
doesFileExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool

-- p/P.hs (the module in question)
module P(ptest) where
import System.Directory
ptest = doesFileExist "no_it_does_not" >>= print

-- p/Q.hs (the second module)
module Q(qtest) where
import System.Directory
qtest = doesFileExist "no_really" >>= print

-- Main.hs (a little test script for the module)
import P
import Q
main = ptest >> qtest
}}}

These files will successfully compile with `ghc --backpack importlist.bkp`.

You can check that other functions from `System.Directory` are not available by editing `P.hs` or `Q.hs` to attempt to use another function from the module, e.g. `doesDirectoryExist`.

**Under construction:** The error message you get when you attempt to use a function which is available from the underlying implementation but not from your signature could be improved.
