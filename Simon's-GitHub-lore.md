# GHC proposals

## Getting a link to the "rendered" proposal

1. Open the PR
2. Just below the PR title, you'll see some text
   ```
   simonpj wants to merge N commits into master from <branch>
   ```
   That <branch> is a link to the branch you're trying to merge, click it.

3. Click the "Go to file" button and navigate to your new proposal, in this case `0000-instance-scoping.rst`.

4. The current URL is appropriate for the "rendered" link
