= The GHC 7.10 Prelude =

GHC 7.10 is coming soon, and we need to decide what the Prelude for GHC 7.10 will look like. The choice is between:

* '''Plan A''' - generalize many of the functions in Prelude, Data.List and Control.Monad from lists to Foldable/Traversable.
* '''Plan B''' - leave the functions working on lists, as they do in GHC 7.8.

Regardless of which plan is chosen, the GHC 7.10 base libraries will incorporate the [https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor-Applicative-Monad_Proposal Applicative-Monad proposal] and the extensions to the Foldable class required to support a future generalization. Plan A then goes on to generalize the following functions:

* From Prelude: all, and, any, concat, concatMap, elem, foldl, foldl1, foldr, foldr1, length, mapM, mapM_, maximum, minimum, notElem, null, or, product, sequence, sequence_, sum
* From Control.Monad: foldM, foldM_, forM, forM_, mapM, mapM_, msum, sequence, sequence_
* From Data.List: all, and, any, concat, concatMap, elem, find, foldl, foldl', foldl1, foldr, foldr1, length, mapAccumL, mapAccumR, maximum, maximumBy, minimum, minimumBy, notElem, null, or, product, sum

== The plan for GHC 7.12 ==

This discussion only covers what will ship with GHC 7.10. The expectation is that if we pick Plan B, then work will be put in place to achieve the goals of the Foldable/Traversable proposal in a future release. Alternatively, if we pick Plan A, it is expected that the Foldable class will evolve in future releases and that some methods in Data.List may become specialized to list once again.

== Reasons for plan A: Generalize in GHC 7.10 ==

* GHC 7.10 RC2 contains an implementation of the Foldable/Traversable generalizations. Authors who have modified their code to work with GHC 7.10 may have to undo some of those changes (but not the Applicative-Monad related changes).
* With Foldable/Traversable there are fewer name clashes in the base library.
* The functions in Prelude become applicable to other data structures, for example Vector and Map.

== Reasons for plan B: Stay with list in GHC 7.10 ==

* There is not yet a consensus on many of the Plan A changes. Another release cycle would give us time to build such a consensus, possibly leading to alterations in the proposal.
* The Prelude is special, as it provides the default functions everyone gets. After Foldable and Traversable are incorporated into the Prelude, they are harder to change.
* There are concerns about which methods are generalized in Plan A, whether methods in Data.List should be restricted to list even if the Prelude is generalized etc. Another release will give us the time to address some of these issues.
* [[Prelude710List]] outlines further concerns and possible approaches to take to achieve the Foldable/Traversable goals in GHC 7.12.
