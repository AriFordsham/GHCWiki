= Trac Support =

Like in most [http://www.opensource.org/ open source projects], Trac support is available primarily through the [trac:MailingList mailing list] and the [trac: project wiki]. Both are maintained by the trac community. The [trac: project wiki] is the authoritative source for the TracGuide, consisting of the administrator and user guides for Trac.

There is an [trac:IrcChannel IRC channel] where online users can help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

You can search questions tagged with `trac` on [SO:tagged/trac Stack Overflow].

Before you start a new support query, make sure you have done the appropriate searching:
 * in the project's [trac:TracFaq FAQ]
 * in past messages to the [http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users Trac Users Mailing List]
 * in the Trac ticket system, using either a [trac:search:?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on full search] or a [trac:query: ticket query].

Please '''don't''' create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org to ask a Trac support question. Only use it when you face a ''real'' and ''new'' bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the [trac:NewTicketGuidelines NewTicketGuidelines]. The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or implemented promptly!
