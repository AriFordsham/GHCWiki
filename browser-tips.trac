== Add a search engine ==

- Firefox: Add a new bookmark.
- Google Chrome: Right-click on the address bar and select `Edit Search Engines`, then you can scroll down and add a new search engine entry.

== Finding tickets by number ==

Add a new bookmark/entry, with
{{{
Name: [#] GHC ticket
Location/URL: http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/%s
Keyword: #
}}}

Then typing `# 5129` in the title bar goes to that ticket (note the
space).

== Searching for tickets ==

Add a new bookmark/entry, with
{{{
Name: [t] GHC ticket search
Location/URL: http://www.google.com/search?q=site:ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket%20%s
Keyword: t
}}}

Now typing `t <query>` into the title bar searches the GHC ticket
database using Google, which is much faster than Trac's search.
