== some misc. notes about submodules ==

 - based on the current access patterns, a few repositories are modified often (specifically,  ghc.git and testsuite.git are often updated in a inter-dependent way); most repositories aren't updated for several weeks; therefore some of the issues outlined with the usability of submodules might have less weight here.

 - Simple migration plan:
    - Fold testsuite.git into ghc.git, as they are strongly inter-dependent. nofib.git and base.git are two other candidates for being folded into ghc.git.
    - All other add-on repositories should be converted into Git submodules.
