== some misc. notes about submodules ==

See also some older notes: DarcsConversion#Theperspectiveonsubmodules

 - based on the current access patterns, a few repositories are modified often (specifically,  ghc.git and testsuite.git are often updated in a inter-dependent way); most repositories aren't updated for several weeks; therefore some of the issues outlined with the usability of submodules might have less weight here.

=== Simple migration plan ===

The plan:

 - Fold testsuite.git into ghc.git, as they are strongly inter-dependent. nofib.git and base.git are two other candidates for being folded into ghc.git.
 - All other add-on repositories should be converted into Git submodules.

The consequences:

 - `ghc.git`'s commit id by itself effectively provides a sufficient source-tree fingerprint; therefore, this renders the `fingerprint.py` superfluous

 - `git bisect` works (almost) out of the box now

 - buildbots don't need to fetch all repos *every time* to check for new commits; it's enough to check `ghc.git`, and only if a new commit in `ghc.git` exists, run `git submodule update`
