Here are notes about using Git that Simon PJ has found useful.

------------------------------
== Configuration ==

=== Push only the current branch ===
When you say `git push` (with no arguments), push only only patches on
the ''current branch''.  If you have un-pushed commits on other branches, leave them be.
{{{
git config --global remote.origin.push HEAD
}}}


=== Creating tracking branches ===

Here is very useful [http://book.git-scm.com/4_tracking_branches.html info on tracking branches].

Suppose you create a new branch on your local machine. Now you want to push
it up to the global repo.  You almost certainly want your local branch to become
a tracking option of the remote one, so that `git pull` will merge changes to
the remote copy into your local copy.

{{{
git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true
}}}

=== Global .gitignore file ===

Here's how to set up a global (across all your projets) `.gitignore` file.
 * Put the file somewhere, eg `$(HOME)/.gitignore`.  The patterns are one per line; e.g. `*.~[0-9]*~` to ignore emacs backup files
 * Execute this command
{{{
git config --global core.excludesfile $(HOME)/.gitignore
}}}

== Looking at the current state of affairs ==

=== Show one-line-per-file diff summary ===

Show a one-line-per-file summary of diffs between working files and the local repo:
{{{
git diff --stat
}}}

=== Show delta between branch and trunk ===

Show the commits that are on branch `my-test` but not on the main trunk:
{{{
git log `git merge-base master my-test`..my-test
}}}
The `git merge-base b1 b2` thing returns the name of the commit that is the common ancestor of branches `b1` and `b2`.

--------------
== Working with branches ==

=== Create a branch after doing some edits ===

You are sitting on a branch (say master), and do some edits. Now you decide it wasn't as simple as you thought so you want to create a branch to keep your edits safe while you do something else. 
{{{
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
}}}
This creates the new branch and switches to it, but '''does not change your working files'''.  Now you can safely commit on the branch [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2569459/git-create-a-branch-from-unstagged-uncommited-changes-on-master Stackoverflow link].  Then to push to the master repo:
{{{
git push origin <new-branch-name>
}}}
That will create `<new-branch-name>` in the master repo if it does not already exist.

=== Work on a branch gotten from the main repo ===

You have done a `git fetch` to get the upstream repo, which has a branch `origin/experiment`.  You want a local `experiment` branch which tracks `origin/experiment`:
{{{
git checkout --track origin/experiment
}}}
This 
 * creates a local branch `experiment`, 
 * sets it up to track `origin/experiment`, and 
 * checks it out
It will fail if local branch `experiment` already exists -- in that case you may want to do the `--set-upstream` thing (see next item). 

If git doesn't know that `origin/experiment` is a branch, the `git checkout` command interprets `origin/experiment` as a filename, and outputs the confusing message
{{{
fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.
Did you intend to checkout 'origin/experiment' which can not be resolved as commit?
}}}
You probably want to do a `git fetch`, then `git branch -r` to see what remote branches there are.

=== Connect up a local branch with its remote counterpart ===

You are on local branch `experiment` and do `git pull` to pull down changes from `origin/experiment`, but you get this:
{{{
You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.experiment.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
}}}
Somehow you in a state where `experiment` isn't tracking `origin/experiment`.  To make it tracking, use `--set-upstream`:
{{{
git branch --set-upstream experiment origin/experiment
}}}

=== Undoing a commit you wish you hadn't made ===

If you have not yet pushed, you can just back up the head pointer one step:
 * `git reset --soft HEAD^`
If you have pushed, you make a commit that exactly undoes what you did, and push that:
 * `git revert HEAD`
See [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#fixing-mistakes the Git manual] and [http://book.git-scm.com/4_undoing_in_git_-_reset,_checkout_and_revert.html the Git Book] on this topic.

== `git gui` on Windows ==

I’ve been using `git gui` (on Windows at least) as a way to examine and stage changes.  But I suddenly found that it wasn’t displaying the diff in the main pane.  

A google search [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/issues/detail?id=394] suggested that (bizarrely) it might have something to do with ‘nice’.  

So I renamed `c:/cygwin/bin/nice.exe to c:/cygwin/bin/cygin-nice.exe`, and that made `git gui` worked fine.  Wierd.
