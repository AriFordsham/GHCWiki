# How to change GHC's documentation


Updating [GHC's documentation](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/) is easy, and can benefit new comers greatly !


GHC's documentation is included within in its source code, using [Haddock's markup](http://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html).


Here are the steps to modify it:

1. **Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr)** on [ GitHub](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/). 
1. **Wait** for the reviewers to look at your patches. If this takes more than a week, complain! 
1. **Wait** for bgamari to publish the documentation. (As of Nov 2017, he runs the publish script manually, about once a month.)  If this takes more than a month, complain on the `#ghc` channel on [FreeNode](http://freenode.net/) !  


Loathe github? You can update documentation using [Phabricator](phabricator) too!


Then have a beer on us.  We are truly grateful.
