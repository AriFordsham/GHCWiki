# How to change GHC's documentation


Updating GHC's documentation is easy, and can benefit new comers greatly !

1. **Create a [ Pull Request](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr)** on [ GitHub](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/). 

1. **Wait** for the reviewers to look at your patches. If this takes more than a week, complain! 
1. **Wait** for the release manager to land your patches. If this takes more than a week, complain!


Then have a beer on us.  We are truly grateful.
