# Useful tools

- Ben Gamari has a bunch of handy, albeit sometimes poorly documented, tools in his [ ghc-utils](http://github.com/bgamari/ghc-utils) repository.
- Joachim Breitner has developed the lovely [ gipeda](http://github.com/nomeata/gipeda) web interface for comparing performance metrics between commits. This powers [ perf.haskell.org](http://perf.haskell.org/) (with data from Joachim's [ ghc-speed-logs](http://github.com/nomeata/ghc-speed-logs) repository
- Ben Gamari has developed a set of [ tools](http://github.com/bgamari/ghc-perf-import) for slurping the `ghc-speed-logs` data into a PostgreSQL database and do interesting timeseries analyses on it.
