This document describes the infrastructure for maintaining GHC's mingw64/mingw32 toolchain tarballs for Windows.

# Why

On Windows, GHC binary distributions ship with a full C compiler/linker toolchain targetting the host platform. These tarballs are generated by the `make sdist` build rules and are derived from mingw toolchains built by the [msys2 project](https://www.msys2.org/). Unfortunately, GHC must patch around a variety of limitations of this toolchain to ensure reliable operation (specifically, working around the `MAX_PATH` limitation). For this, @Phyx has developed a [patch utility](https://github.com/Mistuke/ghc-jailbreak).

# Building the jailbreak utility

The following assumes a Windows machine with both `msys32` and msys64` installed, each with a GCC toolchain:
```
MSYSTEM=MINGW64 PATH=/mingw64/bin:$PATH bash -c "pacman -Suy mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc"
MSYSTEM=MINGW32 PATH=/mingw32/bin:$PATH bash -c "pacman -Suy mingw-w64-i686-gcc"
```

In an msys2 shell

1. `git clone https://github.com/Mistuke/ghc-jailbreak`
2. `cd ghc-jailbreak`
3. In a mingw64 shell: `make`
4. In a mingw32 shell: `make`
4. `tar -czf ghc-jailbreak.tar.gz {x86_64,i686}/{muxcrt.dll,phxcrt.dll,iat-patcher.exe}`

# Building the toolchain tarballs

There are two pieces necessary to generate a toolchain tarball
