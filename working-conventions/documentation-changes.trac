= How to change GHC's documentation =

Updating [https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/ GHC's documentation] is easy, and can benefit new comers greatly !

GHC's documentation is included within in its source code, using [http://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html Haddocks's markup].

Here are the steps to modify it:

0. '''Create a [https://github.com/ghc/ghc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr Pull Request]''' on [https://github.com/ghc/ghc/ GitHub]. 

0. '''Wait''' for the reviewers to look at your patches. If this takes more than a week, complain! [[BR]][[BR]]
0. '''Wait''' for the release manager to land your patches. If this takes more than a week, complain!

Then have a beer on us.  We are truly grateful.
