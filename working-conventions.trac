== Coding conventions ==

There are some documents on coding style:

 * [wiki:Commentary/CodingStyle Coding style in the compiler]
 * [wiki:Commentary/Rts/Conventions Coding style in the runtime system]

== Submitting patches ==

To submit patches to the developers, please use {{{darcs send}}}.  You don't need any special permission to do this.

== Committing changes ==

If you have commit permission (pretty easy to get, just demonstrate your competence by sending us a patch or two first), then you can use {{{darcs push}}} to commit changes directly to the main repository.

{{{
  $ darcs push <account>@darcs.haskell.org:/home/darcs/ghc
}}}

(change {{{ghc}}} to the name of the repository if you're pushing changes from one of the sub-repositories, like {{{testsuite}}}, or a package such as {{{base}}}.  Note: {{{darcs push}}} requires that SSH is working and can log in to your account on {{{darcs.haskell.org}}}.

Do not forget to {{{darcs record}}} your changes first!

Please test changes before committing: you can run a cut-down version of the full test suite like this:

{{{
  $ cd testsuite/tests/ghc-regress
  $ make fast
}}}

You need to have {{{testsuite}}} checked out, of course.  Running {{{make fast}}} should only take a few minutes.
