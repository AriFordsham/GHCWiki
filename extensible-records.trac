= Extensible Records =

There seems to be widespread agreement that the current situation with regards to records is unacceptable, but the [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC:FAQ#Does_GHC_implement_any_kind_of_extensible_records.3F official GHC policy] is that there are too many good ideas to choose from - so nothing gets done!

The purpose of this page is to collect and discuss proposals for adding extensible records to GHC.
