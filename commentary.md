# The GHC Commentary


This tree of wiki pages is a "commentary" on the GHC source code.  It contains all the explanatory material that doesn't belong in comments in the source code itself, because the material is wide-ranging, usually covers multiple source files, and is more architectural in nature.  The commentary can also be considered a design document for GHC.


For the dedicated, there are [videos of Simon and Simon giving an overview of GHC](about-videos), at the 2006 [GHC Hackathon](hackathon).


Please feel free to add material to this commentary: don't worry too much about accuracy, in due course someone will edit your contribution.  Try to link to source files as much as possible by using this macro: `[[GhcFile(compiler/Makefile)]]` (the usual Trac `source:` macro doesn't work here because the GHC darcs repository isn't integrated into this Trac).  Also try to add appropriate links to other parts of the commentary.

## Contributed Documentation


Please edit and improve the Commentary above, or the [Building Guide](building).  


However sometimes you may want to add new material that doesn't quite fit into the existing structure.  Or perhaps your pages are about work-in-progress, status reports and suchlike, which don't belong in the Commentary per se.  Regardless, you can add your new material here.

- The Compiler

  - Notes about Template Haskell?
  - [Notes about the new code generator](commentary/compiler/new-code-gen)
  - [Type families/type functions](type-functions): Notes concerning the implementation of type families, associated types, and equality constraints as well as the extension of the type checker with a contraint solver for equality constraints.
  - [IntermediateTypes](intermediate-types): Notes about the type system of GHC's new intermediate language (in the HEAD since ICFP'06)
  - [DataParallel](data-parallel): Notes about the implementation of Data Parallel Haskell
  - [RewriteRules](rewrite-rules): Notes about the implementation of RULEs in GHC
  - [BackEndNotes](back-end-notes): Some ideas and notes about the back end.
  - [LLVM Back-end](commentary/compiler/backends/llvm): Some notes about the new LLVM back-end for GHC
  - [Cmm: Implementing Exception Handling](commentary/cmm-exceptions): Implementing exception handling for primitive operations in Cmm
  - [Cmm: Using Kinds to implement calling conventions](commentary/cmm-kinds): Pointers to explanations of what a `CmmKind` is and why you might find one useful.
  - [GhciDebugger](ghci-debugger): Some notes about the implementation of the GHCi debugger. Probably uninteresting unless you want to work on the debugger.
  - [NewGhciDebugger](new-ghci-debugger): The new GHCi debugger.
  - [AddingNewPrimitiveOperations](adding-new-primitive-operations): How to add new primitive operations to GHC Haskell.
  - [Replacing GMP](replacing-gmp-notes): Notes from an effort to replace GMP with another Bignum library.
  - [ExternalCore](external-core): Describes the process of bringing External Core up to speed. Once finished, this will simply describe what External Core is, and how it works. 
  - [HaddockComments](haddock-comments): Some notes about how the Haddock comment support is implemented.
  - [ExplicitCallStack](explicit-call-stack): Notes about maintaining an explicit call stack, to support error attribution and profiling.
  - [SQL-Like Comprehensions](sql-like-comprehensions): Notes on the ongoing implementation of SPJs "Comprehensive Comprehensions".

- The Runtime System

  - [GarbageCollectorNotes](garbage-collector-notes) Notes about GHC's existing single threaded garbage collector and development of a parallel GC.
  - [GMPMemoryManagement](gmp-memory-management) Describes how the garbage collector cooperates with GMP for Integer.
  - [SemiTagging](semi-tagging): Describes how the semi-tagging optimisation will be implemented.
  - [PAPI](papi): Measurement of program performance usign CPU events (cache misses, branch mispredictions).

- Other Cross-cutting concerns: topics which span both the compiler and the runtime system

  - How the [Haskell Program Coverage](commentary/hpc) option works
  - [Building/RunningNoFib](building/running-no-fib): The nofib benchmark suite

- [GpHEden](gp-h-eden): All aspects of the GpH and Eden parallel variants of GHC. (*work in progress*)

- [Hackathon presentations](about-videos) (video)

## Old but useful


Finally, here are some generally-useful, but now somewhat-out-of-date resources:

- [ The old GHC Commentary](http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc/docs/comm/): Information on the internals of GHC, in various states of up-to-dateness.  We are keen to move this stuff out of its current location and onto this Wiki.  If anyone is willing to help do that, even for just a part in which you are interested, we would be delighted.
- [GhcPapers](ghc-papers): papers and pointers to other documents that relate to the inner workings of GHC.
