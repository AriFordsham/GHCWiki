# Docker images

All of the Linux builders are run in Docker containers. The images for these builds can be found in the ghc/ci-images> project. They are generated via GitLab Pipelines and pushed to the `gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ci-images` Docker repository.

# GitLab runner configuration

## NixOS

See the `ci-worker.nix` expression in the `ghc-servers` repository. This module can be dropped in `/etc/nixos/` and the following added to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:
```nix
    import = [
      (import ./ghc-ci-worker.nix {name = "NAME"; cores = CORES; token = "TOKEN";})
    ];
```
where `NAME` is a descriptive name, `CORES` is the core count of the machine, and `TOKEN` is a runner token produced by `gitlab-runner register`.

## Non-NixOS
A sample configuration:
```toml
concurrent = 1                    # <---- Set
check_interval = 0

[session_server]
  session_timeout = 1800

[[runners]]
  name = "centriq.haskell.org"    # <---- Set
  url = "https://gitlab.staging.haskell.org/"
  token = "TOKEN"                 # <---- Set
  executor = "docker"
  environment = ["CPUS=16"]       # <---- Set
  output_limit = 16000            # <---- Set
  [runners.docker]
    tls_verify = false
    image = "ghcci/aarch64-linux-deb9:0.1"
    privileged = false
    disable_entrypoint_overwrite = false
    oom_kill_disable = false
    disable_cache = false
    volumes = ["/cache"]
    shm_size = 0
  [runners.cache]
    [runners.cache.s3]
    [runners.cache.gcs]

```

## Job tags

The following job tags are currently defined:

 * `x86_64-linux`
 * `aarch64-linux`
 * `x86_64-darwin`
 * `x86_64-windows`
 * `docker`: supports Docker-in-Docker (used by the ghc/ci-images builds)
 * `lint`: a separate set of x86-64/Linux runner registrations to ensure that linters can always run with minimal latency

## Configuring docker-in-docker

```
 sudo gitlab-runner register -n \
   --url https://gitlab.haskell.org/ \
   --registration-token REGISTRATION_TOKEN \
   --executor docker \
   --description "Docker-in-Docker runner" \
   --docker-image "docker:stable" \
   --docker-privileged
```
See <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-executor>.

## Linux configuration

It is [necessary](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/2980#note_131320536) to ensure that the Docker cache is periodically cleaned:
```bash
$ cat | sudo tee /etc/cron.daily/gitlab-clear-docker-cache <<EOF
#!/bin/sh -e

/usr/share/gitlab-runner/clear-docker-cache
EOF
$ sudo chmod ug+rx /etc/cron.daily/gitlab-clear-docker-cache
```

## Darwin configuration

Install Homebrew.
```
$ brew install autoconf automake python3 wget
```

Install `gitlab-runner` according to
<https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html>.


## Windows configuration

Note: In the case of Windows builders it is important that we run only one build per machine. Unfortunately concurrent builds are simply too fragile under Windows' file locking semantics.

Start with Windows Server GCE image.

Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). When prompted
select `Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software`. Also,
ensure `core.autocrlf` is set to `false` (this can be set during installation or
in `C:\ProgramData\Git\gitconfig` thereafter).

Install msys2.

```
$ pacman -Syuu
$ pacman -S \
    git tar bsdtar unzip binutils autoconf make xz \
    curl libtool automake python python3 p7zip patch ca-certificates \
    mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-gcc mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-python3-sphinx \
    mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-tools-git
```

Create a `gitlab` user with a password.
[Grant](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/faq/README.html#the-service-did-not-start-due-to-a-logon-failure-error-when-starting-service-on-windows)
this account the `SeServiceLogonRight` in the `Local Security Policy` tool.


[Download](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html) 
`gitlab-runner` and place in `C:\GitLabRunner`. In an Administrator shell run,
```
cd C:\GitLabRunner
gitlab-runner install --user ".\gitlab" --password ...
```
Register the runner.

### Optimisation

* To improve IO performance disable creation of 8.3 filenames: `fsutil 8dot3name set 1`.
* To improve IO performance disable last-accessed timestaping: `fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 1`.
* To allow the testsuite driver to use symbolic links grant `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` to the `gitlab` user (using the `Local Security Policy` tool)

Reboot to ensure changes take effect.

## AArch64 configuration

On a Debian/Ubuntu machine as of Dec 2018:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev golang
$ git fetch https://gitlab.com/solidnerd/gitlab-runner.git 
$ git checkout feature/arm64-support
$ cd gitlab-runner
$ make deps
$ make build_simple
$ make out/helper-images/prebuilt-arm64.tar.xz
```
Currently we then just run `out/binaries/gitlab-runner run` in a `tmux` session.

## Head.hackage builds

In addition to building GHC itself, we also provide CI jobs which build a subset of Hackage using the ghc/head.hackage> patchset. This builds can be triggered in one of three ways:

 * By manually running the CI job
 * By pushing to an MR bearing the ~user-facing label
 * Via the scheduled nightly builds

The `head.hackage` CI infrastructure is built on the Nix infrastructure in the `head.hackage` repository. The overall flow of control looks like this:

 1. The  ghc/ghc> pipeline's `hackage` job is triggered
 2. The `hackage` job triggers a pipeline of the ghc/head.hackage> project using a job trigger token owned by @head.hackage, passing its pipeline ID via the `GHC_PIPELINE_ID` variable
 3. The ghc/head.hackage> job uses the value of `GHC_PIPELINE_ID` to lookup the job ID of the pipeline's `x86_64-fedora27` job
 4. The ghc/head.hackage> job fetches the binary distribution of the GHC `x86_64-fedora27` job
 5. The ghc/head.hackage> job uses [ghc-artefact-nix](https://github.com/mpickering/ghc-artefact-nix) to install the bindist
 6. The ghc/head.hackage> job uses `scripts/build-all.nix` to build a subset of Hackage (identified by the `testedPackages` attribute) using the bindist
 7. The ghc/head.hackage> job uses `scripts/summary.py` to produce a summary of the build results. This includes:
    1. a `dot` graph showing the package dependency graph and their failures
    2. a tarball containing the build log files
    3. log output showing abbreviated logs of failed builds
    
    (1) and (2) are then uploaded as artifacts.

Note that this currently requires a patched GitLab installation (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/25712)
