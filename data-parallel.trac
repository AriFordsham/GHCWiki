This page documents the integration of nested data parallelism into GHC at the developer level, including notes about where we are and what needs doing.  See also the [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell user-level wiki page], which includes examples and tutorial-style instructions.

Most of the material describing our approach is partitioned into a set of subpages:

 * [wiki:DataParallel/Example Nested data parallelism by example]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/SMP Data parallelism on shared-memory machines]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/Design High-level design of adding NDP to GHC]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/Library Design of the DPH packages]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/Desugaring Desugaring of array comprehensions]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/VectPragma The VECTORISE pragma]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/Replicate Preventing space blow-up due to replicate]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/Related Other nested data parallel work]
 * [wiki:DataParallel/LiveFusion Live Fusion: An alternative runtime fusion system (WIP)]

== Status ==

Work on the DPH project stopped around 2010 at which point the implementation began to bit-rot. In June 2018 the implementation was removed from the GHC source tree.


== Old status and work plan ==

Detailed information on how to use the current implementation is at the [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell user-level wiki page].  Here is information on the implementation status and outstanding work items:

 * DPH [wiki:DataParallel/Repositories repositories & developer builds]
 * Current [wiki:DataParallel/BenchmarkStatus benchmark status]
 * Release plan [wiki:DataParallel/Dec2010Release]
 * Our [wiki:DataParallel/WorkPlan work plan] [OUT OF DATE]
 * Some early [wiki:DataParallel/Benchmarks benchmarks] from 2007
