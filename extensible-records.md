# Extensible Records


There seems to be widespread agreement that the current situation wrt records is unacceptable, but the [ official GHC policy](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC:FAQ#Does_GHC_implement_any_kind_of_extensible_records.3F) is that there are too many good ideas to choose from - so nothing gets done!


The purpose of this page is to collect and discuss proposals for adding extensible records to GHC.

# Proposals

- [ A proposal for records in Haskell](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Haskell/records.html) (wherein [ TRex](http://cvs.haskell.org/Hugs/pages/hugsman/exts.html#sect7.2) is rejected as having a high implementation cost)
- [ Scoped Labels](http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/download/papers/scopedlabels.pdf)
- [ Type Families](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/b.hilken/files/Records.hs)
- [ Heterogeneous Collections](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/HList/), see also [ Keyword Arguments](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/keyword-arguments.lhs)
- [ Poor Man's Records](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/attachment/ticket/92/Data.Record.hs)
