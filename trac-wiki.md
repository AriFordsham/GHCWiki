# The Trac Wiki Engine


Trac has a built-in wiki engine, used for text and documentation throughout the system. [WikiFormatting](wiki-formatting) is used in [wiki pages](title-index), [tickets](trac-tickets) and [check-in log messages](trac-changeset).  This allows for formatted text and hyperlinks in and between all Trac modules.


Editing wiki text is easy, using any web browser and a simple [formatting system](wiki-formatting), rather than more complex markup languages like HTML.  The reasoning behind its design is that HTML, with its large collection of nestable tags, is too complicated to allow fast-paced editing, and distracts from the actual content of the pages. Note though that Trac also supports [HTML](wiki-html), [reStructuredText](wiki-restructured-text) and [ Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) as alternative markup formats.


The main goal of the wiki is to make editing text easier and *encourage* people to contribute and annotate text content for a project.


The wiki itself does not enforce any structure, but rather resembles a stack of empty sheets of paper, where you can organize information and documentation as you see fit, and later reorganize if necessary.
