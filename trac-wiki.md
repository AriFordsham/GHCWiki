# The Trac Wiki System


Trac has a built-in wiki system which you can use for organizing knowledge and information in a very flexible way by [creating pages](wiki-new-page) containing an intuitive and easy to learn textual markup. This text markup is also used in all other parts of the system, not only in [wiki pages](title-index), but also in [ticket](trac-tickets) description and comments, [check-in log messages](trac-changeset), [milestone](trac-roadmap) descriptions and [report](trac-reports) descriptions, even in third-party extensions.
It allows for formatted text and hyperlinks in and between all Trac modules.


Editing wiki text is easy, using any web browser and a simple [formatting system](wiki-formatting), rather than more complex markup languages like HTML.  The reasoning behind its design is that HTML, with its large collection of nestable tags, is too complicated to allow fast-paced editing, and distracts from the actual content of the pages. Note though that Trac also supports [HTML](wiki-html), [reStructuredText](wiki-restructured-text) and [ Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) as alternative markup formats, which can eventually be used in parts of a page (so called wiki “blocks”).


The main goal of the wiki is to make editing text easier and *encourage* people to contribute and annotate text content for a project. Trac also provides a simple toolbar to make formatting text even easier, and supports the [ universal edit button](http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button) of your browser.


The wiki itself does not enforce any structure, but rather resembles a stack of empty sheets of paper, where you can organize information and documentation as you see fit, and later reorganize if necessary. 
As contributing to a wiki is essentially building an hypertext, 
general advice regarding HTML authoring apply here as well.
For example, the *[ Style Guide for online hypertext](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style)* explains how to think about the
[ overall structure of a work](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/Structure.html) 
and how to organize information [ within each document](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/WithinDocument.html). One of the most important tip is “make your HTML page such that you can read it even if you don't follow any links.”

- How to use [WikiPageNames](wiki-page-names) and other forms of [TracLinks](trac-links) which are used to refer in a precise way to any resource within Trac


If you want to practice editing, please use the [SandBox](sand-box). Note that not all Trac wikis are editable by anyone, this depends on the local policy; check with your Trac administrators.


Before saving your changes, you can *Preview* the page or *Review the Changes* you've made.
You can get an automatic preview of the formatting as you type when you activate the *Edit Side-by-side* mode (you have to Preview the page for the setting to take effect). * There is a [configurable delay](trac-ini#) between when you make your edit and when the automatic preview will update.*
