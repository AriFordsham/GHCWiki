This page lists the active repositories relating to GHC. For instructions on actually getting a GHC source tree, see [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources Getting The Sources].

For read-only browsing, you can use the:
 * [source: Trac source browser]
 * [http://git.haskell.org/ Gitweb browser @ git.haskell.org]
 * [http://github.com/ghc/ghc GitHub GHC mirror]

For info on the active branches of the main GHC repo, see
 * [wiki:ActiveBranches]

GHC's repos use git; see [wiki:WorkingConventions/Git Git Working Conventions].

'''Be sure to read more on the working conventions for submodules, which are thoroughly documented here''': https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/WorkingConventions/Git/Submodules

== GHC Repositories ==

The GHC source code tracks many related sub-repositories, which are needed for external dependencies during the build, or tools that are included in the build. Not every sub-repository is maintained by us; in fact, the large majority are ''not'' maintained by GHC HQ.

As a result of this, in HEAD, essentially every single upstream repository we track is tracked with a '''git submodule'''. These submodules are mirrored for us, and we send patches we need to the upstream maintainer.

But what happens if ''you'' need to get a submodule updated? It's quite simple...

=== Sending patches upstream, the short version ===

 * Send a patch upstream. Get it merged.

 * Once that is done, just update the submodule:

 {{{
cd libraries/foo
git reset --hard some_commit_id
cd ../..
git commit -asm "Update foo submodule"
./sync-all push
}}}
 where `some_commit_id` should be the commit ID of the change you pushed. For example, if you pushed three changes (where 'Commit #3' is the latest HEAD):

 {{{
026d0f64723729823ef29991218c7a15d8d37264 - Commit #1
235da0f3e38c2b4c489a82778a5fd84a895cb693 - Commit #2
0667f01823552caf97c4d6e8b876b1d9db00a172 - Commit #3
}}}
 then `some_commit_id = 0667f01823552caf97c4d6e8b876b1d9db00a172`

 * Done!

=== Submodule reference validation ===

There is a problem with submodules, in that it would be possible to commit a submodule change to `ghc.git`, which points to an invalid commit. For example, perhaps you make a change to `haddock` and `ghc`. You might accidentally push to `ghc` before pushing to Haddock, or worse, you might forget.

For this reason, the GHC repository has commit hooks that validate submodule references. Any time you update a submodule, you must:

 * Have already pushed the new changes upstream, in a way `git` can find them.

 * You **must** include the word '**submodule**' in your commit message.

If either of these assumptions are violated, your push will fail.

== Full repository breakdown ==

A GHC source tree is made of a collection of repositories. Here is a list of the repositories that GHC uses.  The columns have the following meaning

 * '''Location in tree''': where in the source tree this repository sits.

 * '''Upstream repo?''': if "yes", this library is maintained by someone else, 
   and its master repo is somewhere else.  See [wiki:Repositories/Upstream].

 * '''Reqd to build?''': is "no" if this library is not required to build GHC. We have a few of these because we use them for tests and suchlike.

 * '''Installed?''': is "no" if the library is not installed in a GHC installation, and "extra" if it is only installed if `InstallExtraPackages` is `YES`. All others are installed with GHC. See the [wiki:Commentary/Libraries libraries page] for more info.

 * '''GHC repo''': in every case there is a repo on `http://git.haskell.org/`, which contains the bits we use for building GHC every night. For libraries with upstream repos, this is just a lagging mirror of the master (see [wiki:Repositories/Upstream]).  The read-only HTTP URL for the repo is `http://git.haskell.org/<table-entry>`.  To get a read/write URL, replace HTTP prefix `http://git.haskell.org` with the SSH prefix `ssh://git@git.haskell.org`.

== Mirroring new packages to !GitHub ==

Currently, all our repositories are being mirrored to !GitHub by !GitHub themselves. If you wish to add/remove a repository you need to email !GitHub support at support@github.com and ask them to do it. Currently there is no way to administer this ourselves.
