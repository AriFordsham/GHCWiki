# Compiler performance


This is where we track various efforts to characterize and improve the performance of the compiler itself. If you are interested in the performance of code generated by GHC, see [Performance/Runtime](performance/runtime).

## Relevant tickets


Identify tickets by using "Compile time performance bug" for the "Type of failure field".


Here's a list:

[ https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=!closed&failure=Compile-time+performance+bug](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=!closed&failure=Compile-time+performance+bug)

### Type pile-up


Some programs can produce very deeply nested types of non-linear size. See [ Scrap your type applications](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/variant-f/index.htm) for a way to improve these bad cases

- [\#9198](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/9198): large performance regression in type checker speed in 7.8 

  - Types in Core blowing up quadratically (as seen in `-ddump-ds` output)

### Coercion pile-up


One theme that seems to pop up rather often is the production of Core with long strings of coercions, with the size scaling non-linearly with the size of the types in the source program. These may or may not be due to similar root-causes.

- [\#8095](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8095): TypeFamilies painfully slow

  - Here a recursive type family instance leads to quadratic blow-up of coercions

  This ticket has a discussion about a way to snip off coercions when not using `-dcore-lint`.

- [\#7428](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/7428): GHC compile times are seriously non-linear in program size

  - Here a CPS'd State monad is leading to a quadratic blowup in Core size over successive simplifier iterations

- [\#5642](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/5642): Deriving Generic of a big type takes a long time and lots of space

- [\#14338](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/14338): Simplifier fails with "Simplifier ticks exhausted"

  - Specialised dictionaries parametrized on a type-level list produce very large coercions.


One possible solution (proposed in [\#8095](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8095)) is to eliminate coercions from the Core AST during usual compilation, instead only including them when we want to lint the Core.

### Deriving instances


Another theme often seen is issues characterized by perceived slowness during compilation of code deriving instances. This could be due to a number of reasons,

1. the implementation of the logic responsible for producing the instance code is inefficient
1. the instance itself is large but could be expressed more concisely
1. the instance itself is large but irreducibly so


While it's possible to fix (1) and (2), (3) is inherent.

### Uncategorised compiler performance issues

- [\#2346](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/2346): desugaring let-bindings
- [\#10228](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/10228): increase in compiler memory usage, regression from 7.8.4 to 7.10.1
- [\#10289](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/10289): 2.5k static HashSet takes too much memory to compile

  - Significantly improved in memory usage from [\#10370](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/10370), but worse at overall wall-clock time!
- [\#7450](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/7450): Regression in optimisation time of functions with many patterns (6.12 to 7.4)? 

  - [ Phab:D1041](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1041), [ Phab:D1012](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1012)
  - Unnecessary recomputation of free variables ([ Phab:D1012](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1012))
  - Thunk leak in `Bitmap` ([ Phab:D1040](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1040))
- [\#10800](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/10800): vector-0.11 compile time increased substantially with 7.10.1

  - Regression in `vector` testsuite perhaps due to change in inlinings
- [\#13639](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/13639): Skylighting package compilation is glacial 

## nofib results

- See [ this run](https://gist.github.com/bgamari/ff4592ae89c5b7d7751180b967e55590) comparing GHC 7.4.2 through 8.0.1

## `tests/perf/compiler` results

### 7.6 vs 7.8

- A bit difficult to decipher, since a lot of the stats/surrounding numbers were totally rewritten due to some Testsuite API overhauls.
- The results are a mix; there are things like `peak_megabytes_allocated` being bumped up a lot, but a lot of them also had `bytes_allocated` go down as well. This one seems pretty mixed.

### 7.8 vs 7.10

- Things mostly got **better** according to these, not worse!
- Many of them had drops in `bytes_allocated`, for example, `T4801`.
- The average improvement range is something like 1-3%.
- But one got much worse; `T5837`'s `bytes_allocated` jumped from 45520936 to 115905208, 2.5x worse!

### 7.10 vs HEAD

- Most results actually got **better**, not worse!
- Silent superclasses made HEAD drop in several places, some noticeably over 2x

  - `max_bytes_used` increased in some cases, but not much, probably GC wibbles.
- No major regressions, mostly wibbles.

## Compile/build times


(NB: Sporadically updated)

**As of April 22nd, 2016**:

- GHC HEAD: 14m9s  (via 7.8.3) (because of Joachim's call-arity improvements)
- GHC 7.10: 15m43s (via 7.8.3)
- GHC 7.8:  12m54s (via 7.8.3)
- GHC 7.6:  8m19s  (via 7.4.1)


Random note: GHC 7.10's build system actually disabled DPH (half a dozen more packages and probably a hundred extra modules), yet things \*still\* got slower over time!

## Interesting third-party library numbers

- Compile time of some example program (`fluid-tree`) of `fltkhs` library increased from about 15 seconds to more than a minute ([ original message](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2016-May/123995.html)).
- GHC takes significantly more memory compiling the `xmlhtml` library with `-j4` than `-j1` (1GB vs 150MB). See [\#9370](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/9370). 
- The `Language.Haskell.Exts.Annotated.Syntax` of `haskell-src-exts` takes many tens of seconds to compile. Howeever, this may not be surprising: Consists of roughly 70 data definitions, some with many constructors, `deriving (Eq,Ord,Show,Typeable,Data,Foldable,Traversable)` on most of them as well as defining `Functor`.
- `vector-algorithms` may be a nice test and reportedly got slower to compile and run in recent GHC releases.

## Relevant changes

### GHC 7.10 to GHC 8.0

- The performance effect of the `TypeInType` merge shows up in [b5d5d83122c93c2a25839127edfd6b2df7ed6928](/trac/ghc/changeset/b5d5d83122c93c2a25839127edfd6b2df7ed6928/ghc) ("Revert .gitmodules changes from 6746549772c5") due to various broken intermediate commits.
- [91c6b1f54aea658b0056caec45655475897f1972](/trac/ghc/changeset/91c6b1f54aea658b0056caec45655475897f1972/ghc) is a refactoring of the `Typeable` implementation which moves `Typeable` dictionary generation from evidence generation time to the point where the represented type is defined. This tends to regress compile allocations by a few percent for programs defining lots of types (although programs which make large use of `Typeable` may see improvement).
- Improvements in code generation ([\#7450](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/7450), [b29633f5cf310824f3e34716e9261162ced779d3](/trac/ghc/changeset/b29633f5cf310824f3e34716e9261162ced779d3/ghc)) and simplification ([4681f55970cabc6e33591d7e698621580818f9a2](/trac/ghc/changeset/4681f55970cabc6e33591d7e698621580818f9a2/ghc))

### GHC 8.0 to GHC 8.2

- [f53d761df9762232b54ec57a950d301011cd21f8](/trac/ghc/changeset/f53d761df9762232b54ec57a950d301011cd21f8/ghc) ("TysWiredIn: Use UniqFM lookup for built-in OccNames") improves the efficiency of built-in `OccName` lookup, resulting in a 2-5% improvement in compiler allocations on nofib. This was noticed due to unexpectedly large allocations regressions in [dd3080fe0263082f65bf2570f49189c277b12e28](/trac/ghc/changeset/dd3080fe0263082f65bf2570f49189c277b12e28/ghc) ([\#12357](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/12357)).
- [ed4809813fa51524ae73a4475afe33018a67f87d](/trac/ghc/changeset/ed4809813fa51524ae73a4475afe33018a67f87d/ghc) ("InstEnv: Ensure that instance visibility check is lazy") fixes a bug introduced earlier change ([4c834fdddf4d44d12039da4d6a2c63a660975b95](/trac/ghc/changeset/4c834fdddf4d44d12039da4d6a2c63a660975b95/ghc)) in the instance visibility check which broke laziness of instance resolution. This reduces compiler allocations by roughly 5-10% on nofib. The underlying bug was noticed by unexpectedly large allocation regressions due to [673efccb3b348e9daf23d9e65460691bbea8586e](/trac/ghc/changeset/673efccb3b348e9daf23d9e65460691bbea8586e/ghc) and [4e6bcc2c8134f9c1ba7d715b3206130f23c529fb](/trac/ghc/changeset/4e6bcc2c8134f9c1ba7d715b3206130f23c529fb/ghc), which added instances to various `base` modules ([\#12367](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/12367)).
- [eb3d6595735671605c5d6294a796dc0f16f784a4](/trac/ghc/changeset/eb3d6595735671605c5d6294a796dc0f16f784a4/ghc) ("OccName: Avoid re-encoding derived OccNames") is a refactoring which reduces allocations in the computation of derived `OccName`s by eliminating `String` intermediates.

### GHC 8.2 to GHC 8.4

- Regressions: [\#14944](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/14944), [\#14928](https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/14928)
