= Compiler performance =

This is where we track various efforts to characterize and improve the performance of the compiler itself. If you are interested in the performance of code generated by GHC, see [[Performance/Runtime]].

== Relevant tickets ==

 * #2346: desugaring let-bindings
 * #7428: Non-linear compile time: addFingerprint??
   - Still a huge problem with GHC 7.10.1: looks like quadratic behavior around `TidyCore`/`CorePrep`.
 * #9583, #9630: code blowup in Generics/Binary
 * #10228: increase in compiler memory usage, regression from 7.8.4 to 7.10.1
 * #10289: 2.5k static HashSet takes too much memory to compile
   - Significantly improved in memory usage from #10370, but worse at overall wall-clock time!
 * #10370: OpenGLRaw

 * #8731: long compilation time for module with large data type and partial record selectors 
 * #7258: Compiling DynFlags is jolly slow
 * #7450: Regression in optimisation time of functions with many patterns (6.12 to 7.4)? 
   * Phab:D1041, Phab:D1012
   * Unnecessary recomputation of free variables (Phab:D1012)
   * Thunk leak in `Bitmap` (Phab:D1040)
 * #9669: Long compile time/high memory usage for modules with many deriving clauses

=== Coercion pile-up ===

One theme that seems to pop up rather often is the production of Core with long strings of coercions, with the size scaling non-linearly with the size of the types in the source program. These may or may not be due to similar root-causes.

 * #8095: TypeFamilies painfully slow
    * Here a recursive type family instance leads to quadratic blow-up of coercions
 * #7428: GHC compile times are seriously non-linear in program size
    * Here a CPS'd State monad is leading to a quadratic blowup in Core size over successive simplifier iterations
 * #5642: Deriving Generic of a big type takes a long time and lots of space

One possible solution (proposed in #8095) is to eliminate coercions from the Core AST during usual compilation, instead only including them when we want to lint the Core.

=== Deriving instances ===

Another theme often seen is issues characterized by perceived slowness during compilation of code deriving instances. These don't usually share much as far as root-cause is concerned, but nevertheless this is a useful categorization,

 * #9557: Deriving instances is slow
 * #10858: Smaller generated `Ord` instances
 * #10980: quadratic behaviour of derived `Read`.
 * #5642: Deriving Generic of a big type takes a long time and lots of space

== tests/perf/compiler` results ==

=== 7.6 vs 7.8 ===

  - A bit difficult to decipher, since a lot of the stats/surrounding numbers were totally rewritten due to some Testsuite API overhauls.
  - The results are a mix; there are things like `peak_megabytes_allocated` being bumped up a lot, but a lot of them also had `bytes_allocated` go down as well. This one seems pretty mixed.
  
=== 7.8 vs 7.10 ===

  - Things mostly got **better** according to these, not worse!
  - Many of them had drops in `bytes_allocated`, for example, `T4801`.
  - The average improvement range is something like 1-3%.
  - But one got much worse; `T5837`'s `bytes_allocated` jumped from 45520936 to 115905208, 2.5x worse!

=== 7.10 vs HEAD ===

  - Most results actually got **better**, not worse!
  - Silent superclasses made HEAD drop in several places, some noticeably over 2x
    - `max_bytes_used` increased in some cases, but not much, probably GC wibbles.
  - No major regressions, mostly wibbles.

== Compile/build times ==

(NB: Sporadically updated)

'''As of April 22nd''':

  - GHC HEAD: 14m9s  (via 7.8.3) (because of Joachim's call-arity improvements)
  - GHC 7.10: 15m43s (via 7.8.3)
  - GHC 7.8:  12m54s (via 7.8.3)
  - GHC 7.6:  8m19s  (via 7.4.1)

Random note: GHC 7.10's build system actually disabled DPH (half a dozen more packages and probably a hundred extra modules), yet things *still* got slower over time!
