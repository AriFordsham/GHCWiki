# Trac Logging


Trac supports logging of system messages using the standard [ logging module](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) that comes with Python.


Logging is configured in the `[logging]` section in [trac.ini](trac-ini#).

## Supported Logging Methods


The log method is set using the `log_type` option in [trac.ini](trac-ini#), which takes any of the following values:

<table><tr><th>**none****</th>
<td>Suppress all log messages.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**file**</th>
<td>Log messages to a file, specified with the `log_file` option in [trac.ini](trac-ini#). Relative paths in `log_file` are resolved relative to the `log` directory of the environment.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**stderr**</th>
<td>Output all log entries to console ([tracd](trac-standalone) only).
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**syslog**</th>
<td>(UNIX) Send all log messages to the local syslogd via named pipe `/dev/log`. By default, syslog will write them to the file /var/log/messages.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**eventlog**</th>
<td>(Windows) Use the system's NT Event Log for Trac logging.
</td></tr></table>

## Log Levels


The verbosity level of logged messages can be set using the `log_level` option in [trac.ini](trac-ini#). The log level defines the minimum level of urgency required for a message to be logged, and those levels are:

<table><tr><th>**CRITICAL**</th>
<td>Log only the most critical (typically fatal) errors.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**ERROR**</th>
<td>Log failures, bugs and errors. 
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**WARN**</th>
<td>Log warnings, non-interrupting events.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**INFO**</th>
<td>Diagnostic information, log information about all processing.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**DEBUG**</th>
<td>Trace messages, profiling, etc.
</td></tr></table>


Note that starting with Trac 0.11.5 you can in addition enable logging of SQL statements, at debug level. This is turned off by default, as it's very verbose (set `[trac] debug_sql = yes` in [TracIni](trac-ini) to activate).

## Log Format


Starting with Trac 0.10.4 (see [ \#2844](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/%232844)), it is possible to set the output format for log entries. This can be done through the `log_format` option in [trac.ini](trac-ini#). The format is a string which can contain any of the [ Python logging Formatter variables](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes). Additonally, the following Trac-specific variables can be used:

<table><tr><th>**$(basename)s**</th>
<td>The last path component of the current environment.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**$(path)s**</th>
<td>The absolute path for the current environment.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>**$(project)s**</th>
<td>The originating project's name.
</td></tr></table>


Note that variables are identified using a dollar sign (`$(...)s`) instead of percent sign (`%(...)s`).


The default format is:

```wiki
log_format = Trac[$(module)s] $(levelname)s: $(message)s
```


In a multi-project environment where all logs are sent to the same place (e.g. `syslog`), it makes sense to add the project name. In this example we use `basename` since that can generally be used to identify a project:

```wiki
log_format = Trac[$(basename)s:$(module)s] $(levelname)s: $(message)s
```
