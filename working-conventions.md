# Working on GHC


GHC is a BSD-licensed open-source project, and we welcome your help in making it better.
This page has pointers to information you'll need.

- Read the [GHC Newcomers page](newcomers), dedicated to helping newcomers in getting started and tackling their first bugs.

- [Register an account](/trac/ghc/register) on this GHC Trac, so that you can edit pages.  Editing advice is in the "Wiki" links in the green sidebar on the left of every page

- Subscribe to the [ ghc-devs mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-devs).  This list is the place to discuss ongoing development of GHC. [ ghc-commits](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-commits) gets an email for every commit that is made, and reports generated by the automated nightly builders go to [ ghc-builds](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-builds). Additionally, trac ticket discussions can be followed in [ ghc-tickets](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-tickets). These lists are high volume, so you probably want to at least filter them into separate folders/labels.

- Talk to other members of the [GHC Team](team-ghc).

- Read the [GHC reading list](reading-list) and the [commentary on the source code](commentary).

- Read the [building guide](building) (link always in the left hand margin) to learn how to build and test GHC.


The following pages guide you step-by-step through making a contribution:

- [How to fix a bug in GHC](working-conventions/fixing-bugs). You can see all open bugs by clicking on "All bugs" in the left margin of this page.  At the top of the list is a filter you can use to refine your search.  Also check out the (currently stalled) [GHC bug sweep](bug-sweep).  Perhaps you can un-stall it.

- [How to add a new feature to GHC](working-conventions/adding-features). You can see all open feature requests by clicking on "All bugs" in the left margin of this page.  At the top of the list is a filter you can use to refine your search.

- [ How to propose a change to the libraries](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Library_submissions)

## Working conventions

- **Using Git**: Our conventions and some useful tips for using git are here: [Using Git](working-conventions/git), and information about our submodule setup is in [WorkingConventions/Git/Submodules](working-conventions/git/submodules).

- **Using Phabricator**: we use Phabricator as a code review tool; here are [our Phabricator guidance notes](phabricator).

- **Releases and branches**: Our conventions for making releases and how the branches are managed: [Releases](working-conventions/releases)

- **Using the Bug Tracker**: see [Using the Bug Tracker](working-conventions/bug-tracker)

- **Coding style**: When you are editing GHC's source code, please follow our coding guidelines:

  - [Coding style in the compiler](commentary/coding-style)
  - [Coding style in the runtime system](commentary/rts/conventions)

- **Testing**: all patches that go into GHC must first pass *validation*, which ensures that a basic build works and the *regression test suite* passes.

  - The policy on validating patches, and how to perform validation, is at: [Testing Patches](testing-patches).
  - Details about the regression test suite, and how to use it are at: [Running Tests](building/running-tests).

- **Licensing**: make sure you are familiar with GHC's [Licensing](licensing).  Unless you say otherwise, we will assume that if you submit a contribution to GHC, then you intend to supply it to us under the same license as the existing code. However, we do not ask for copyright attribution; you retain copyright on any contributions you make, so feel free to add your copyright to the top of any file in which you make non-trivial changes.

## Tips and Tricks

- To have an easier time looking up tickets and searching trac, use [the browser tips page](browser-tips) to make your search and lookups for Trac tickets substantially easier.

- If you use Emacs, see [Emacs](emacs) for some useful stuff to put in your `.emacs` file.

- If you have lots of Haskell installations, you may find Edsko's blog post [ Comprehensive Haskell Sandboxes](http://www.edsko.net/2013/02/10/comprehensive-haskell-sandboxes/) useful.
