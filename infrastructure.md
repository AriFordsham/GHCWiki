# Developerâ€™s Infrastructure


There are a number of services and tools that GHC developers should be aware of.

## Official tools

- Our [git repositories](repositories), which are best used following the [ Working Conventions](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/)
- The trac instance you are just using, which hosts the [wiki](/trac/ghc/wiki) and the [bug tracker](/trac/ghc/report)
- Our [mailing lists](mailing-lists-and-irc)
- For code review, we use a [Phabricator](phabricator) instance at [ https://phabricator.haskell.org/](https://phabricator.haskell.org/)
- We use [Travis](travis) to validate each new commit: see [ https://travis-ci.org/ghc/ghc/builds](https://travis-ci.org/ghc/ghc/builds) for the current status

## Beta tools


These tools are currently being evaluated.

- A dashboard tracking the performance numbers of each commit is running at [ http://ghcspeed-nomeata.rhcloud.com/](http://ghcspeed-nomeata.rhcloud.com/) by nomeata

## External tools


There are a bunch of external services that might be of interest to GHC developers:
