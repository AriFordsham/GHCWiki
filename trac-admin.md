# [TracAdmin](trac-admin)


Trac is distributed with a powerful command-line configuration tool. This tool can be used  to configure and customize your Trac-installation to better fit your needs.


Some of those operations can also be performed via the *Admin* web interface, an updated version of the [ WebAdmin](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/WebAdmin) plugin now integrated within Trac (since version 0.11).

## Usage


For nearly every `trac-admin` command, you'll need to specify the path to the [TracEnvironment](trac-environment) that you want to administer as the first argument, for example:

```wiki
trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki list
```


The only exception is for the `help` command, but even in this case if you omit the environment, you'll only get a very succinct list of commands (`help` and `initenv`), the same list you'd get when invoking `trac-admin` alone.
Also, `trac-admin --version` will tell you about the Trac version (e.g. 0.12) corresponding to the program.


If you want to get a comprehensive list of the available commands and sub-commands, you need to specify an existing environment:

```wiki
trac-admin /path/to/projenv help
```


Some commands have a more detailed help, which you can access by specifying the command's name as a subcommand for `help`:

```wiki
trac-admin /path/to/projenv help <command>
```

### `trac-admin <targetdir> initenv`


This subcommand is very important as it's the one used to create a [TracEnvironment](trac-environment) in the specified `<targetdir>`. That directory must not exist prior to the call.

initenv \[\<projectname\> \<db\> \[\<repostype\> \<repospath\>\]\]

    Create and initialize a new environment

    If no arguments are given, then the required parameters are requested
    interactively unless the optional argument \`--config\` is specified.

    One or more optional arguments --inherit=PATH can be used to specify the
    "\[inherit\] file" option at environment creation time, so that only the
    options not already specified in one of the global configuration files are
    written to the conf/trac.ini file of the newly created environment.
    Relative paths are resolved relative to the "conf" directory of the new
    environment.

    The optional argument --config=PATH can be used to specify a configuration
    file that is used to populate the environment configuration. The arguments
    \<projectname\>, \<db\> and any other arguments passed in the invocation are
    optional, but if specified will override values in the configuration file.


It supports an extra `--inherit` option, which can be used to specify a global configuration file which can be used share settings between several environments. You can also inherit from a shared configuration afterwards, by setting the `[inherit] file` option in the `conf/trac.ini` file in your newly created environment, but the advantage of specifying the inherited configuration file at environment creation time is that only the options *not* already specified in the global configuration file will be written in the created environment's `conf/trac.ini` file.
See [TracIni\#GlobalConfiguration](trac-ini#global-configuration).


Note that in version 0.11 of Trac, `initenv` lost an extra last argument `<templatepath>`, which was used in previous versions to point to the `templates` folder. If you are using the one-liner '`trac-admin /path/to/trac/ initenv <projectname> <db> <repostype> <repospath>`' in the above and getting an error that reads **'`Wrong number of arguments to initenv: 4`**', then this is because you're using a `trac-admin` script from an **older** version of Trac.

## Interactive Mode


When passing the environment path as the only argument, `trac-admin` starts in interactive mode.
Commands can then be executed on the selected environment using the prompt, which offers tab-completion
(on non-Windows environments, and when the Python `readline` module is available) and automatic repetition of the last command issued.


Once you're in interactive mode, you can also get help on specific commands or subsets of commands:


For example, to get an explanation of the `resync` command, run:

```wiki
> help resync
```


To get help on all the Wiki-related commands, run:

```wiki
> help wiki
```

## Full Command Reference


You'll find below the detailed help for all the commands available by default in `trac-admin`. Note that this may not match the list given by `trac-admin <yourenv> help`, as the commands  pertaining to components disabled in that environment won't be available and conversely some plugins activated in the environment can add their own commands.

initenv \[\<projectname\> \<db\> \[\<repostype\> \<repospath\>\]\]

    Create and initialize a new environment

    If no arguments are given, then the required parameters are requested
    interactively unless the optional argument \`--config\` is specified.

    One or more optional arguments --inherit=PATH can be used to specify the
    "\[inherit\] file" option at environment creation time, so that only the
    options not already specified in one of the global configuration files are
    written to the conf/trac.ini file of the newly created environment.
    Relative paths are resolved relative to the "conf" directory of the new
    environment.

    The optional argument --config=PATH can be used to specify a configuration
    file that is used to populate the environment configuration. The arguments
    \<projectname\>, \<db\> and any other arguments passed in the invocation are
    optional, but if specified will override values in the configuration file.

    to set the completion date to the current time. To remove the completion
    date from a milestone, specify an empty string ("").

milestone due \<name\> \<due\>

    Set milestone due date

    The \<due\> date must be specified in the "MM/dd/YY hh:mm:ss" or "YYYY-MM-
    DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm" (ISO 8601) format. Alternatively, "now" can be used to

repository resync \<repos\> \[rev\]

    Re-synchronize trac with repositories

    When \[rev\] is specified, only that revision is synchronized. Otherwise, the
    complete revision history is synchronized. Note that this operation can
    take a long time to complete. If synchronization gets interrupted, it can
    be resumed later using the \`sync\` command.

    To synchronize all repositories, specify "\*" as the repository.

    The following keys are supported: alias, description, dir, hidden, name,
    sync_per_request, type, url

repository sync \<repos\> \[rev\]

    Resume synchronization of repositories

    It works like \`resync\`, except that it doesn't clear the already
    synchronized changesets, so it's a better way to resume an interrupted
    \`resync\`.

    See \`resync\` help for detailed usage.

    makes it authenticated (the default if no suffix is specified).

session delete \<sid\[:0\|1\]\> \[...\]

    Delete the session of the specified sid

    An sid suffix ':0' operates on an unauthenticated session with the given
    sid, and a suffix ':1' on an authenticated session (the default).
    Specifying the sid 'anonymous' will delete all anonymous sessions.

session list \[sid\[:0\|1\]\] \[...\]

    List the name and email for the given sids

    Specifying the sid 'anonymous' lists all unauthenticated sessions, and
    'authenticated' all authenticated sessions. '\*' lists all sessions, and is

    DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm" (ISO 8601) format. Alternatively, "now" can be used to
    set the version date to the current time. To remove the date from a
    version, specify an empty string ("").

wiki dump \<directory\> \[page\] \[...\]

    Export wiki pages to files named by title

    Individual wiki page names can be specified after the directory. A name
    ending with a \* means that all wiki pages starting with that prefix should
    be dumped. If no name is specified, all wiki pages are dumped.

wiki export \<page\> \[file\]

    Export wiki page to file or stdout

wiki import \<page\> \[file\]

    Import wiki page from file or stdin

wiki list 

    List wiki pages

wiki load \<path\> \[...\]

    If a given path is a file, it is imported as a page with the name of the
    file. If a path is a directory, all files in that directory are imported.

wiki remove \<page\>

    Remove wiki page

wiki rename \<page\> \<new_name\>

    Rename wiki page

wiki replace \<path\> \[...\]

    Replace the content of wiki pages from files (DANGEROUS!)

    This command replaces the content of the last version of one or more wiki
    pages with new content. The previous content is lost, and no new entry is
    created in the page history. The metadata of the page (time, author) is not
    changed either.

    If a given path is a file, it is imported as a page with the name of the
    file. If a path is a directory, all files in that directory are imported.

    WARNING: This operation results in the loss of the previous content and
    cannot be undone. It may be advisable to backup the current content using
    "wiki dump" beforehand.

wiki upgrade 

    Upgrade default wiki pages to current version
