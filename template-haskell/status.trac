== TH tickets suitable for newcomers ==

New to hacking on GHC? Try one of these:

[[TicketQuery(status=new|infoneeded,keywords=~newcomer,owner=,component=Template Haskell)]]

== Patched TH tickets: ==

These are presumably waiting for review.

[[TicketQuery(status=patch,component=Template Haskell,format=table,col=differential|milestone|summary|priority|owner,order=priority)]]

== Open TH tickets: ==

If you know of a ticket not listed here, please set its "Category" to be "Template Haskell" and it should show up.
