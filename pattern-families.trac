This is a proposal for allowing '''families of patterns''' indexed by expressions.

== Syntax ==
The syntax from PatternSynonyms could be reused for simplicity:

{{{
pattern Take n xs <- (take n -> xs)
}}}

here `xs` is a normal variable as in PatternSynonyms but `n` is the expression the pattern is indexed by: this can be inferred from it appearing in the ViewPatterns expression (`take n`) rather than in the pattern.

`Take 0`, `Take 1`, `Take 2` would be equivalent to the following pattern definitions:

{{{
pattern Take0 xs <- (take 0 -> xs)
pattern Take1 xs <- (take 1 -> xs)
pattern Take2 xs <- (take 2 -> xs)
...
}}}

=== Grammar ===
A simple grammar would then be

    `pattern` ''conid'' ''varid,,1,,'' .. ''varid,,n,,'' `<-` (''expr'' `->` ''pat'')

where each ''varid,,i,,'' must be free in either ''expr'' or ''pat''.

== Dynamic semantics (Desugaring) ==
More concretely, a pattern definition has the form:

    `pattern` ''conid'' [''evarid,,i,,'', ''pvarid,,j,,''] `<-` (''expr'' `->` ''pat'')

where [''evarid,,i,,'', ''pvarid,,j,,''] denotes some interleaving of variables that appear in ''expr'' or ''pat''. When matched against, all ''evarid,,i,,'' must be instantiated with expresions ''expr,,i,,'':

    `fn` (''conid'' [''expr,,i,,'', ''pvarid,,j,,'']) = `result`

where ''pvarid,,j,,'' may appear in `result` as in usual patterns. This then gets translated into the following view pattern:

    `fn` (''expr''[''evarid,,i,,'' := ''expr,,i,,''] `->` `pat`) = `result`

For the simple example of the pattern family `Take` this (where 3 is ''expr,,1,,'' and `xs` is ''pval,,1,,''):

{{{
    foo (Take 3 xs) = xs ++ xs
}}}

would get translated to:

{{{
    foo (take 3 -> xs) = xs ++ xs
}}}

which is the same as:

{{{
    foo ys = case take 3 ys of
      xs -> xs ++ xs
}}}

== Static semantics (Typing) ==
If ''expr'' in the view pattern is an expression of type ''t'' with free variables ''evarid,,i,,'' of type ''t,,i,,'' then an ''expr,,i,,'' used to instantiate the corresponding ''evarid,,i,,'' must have a type ''u,,i,,'' that unifies with ''t,,i,,'', the final expression ''expr'' will have type ''t''. Otherwise same typing and scoping rules as [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ViewPatterns#Semantics ViewPatterns].

== Motivating examples ==

=== Types ===
Example from ViewPatterns:

{{{
   type Typ
 
   data TypView = Unit
                | Arrow Typ Typ

   view :: Typ -> TypView

   size (view -> Unit) = 1
   size (view -> Arrow t1 t2) = size t1 + size t2
}}}

=== Type checking ===
From [http://itu.dk/people/drc/tutorials/bidirectional.pdf Bidirectional Typing Rules: A Tutorial]:

{{{
    inferType ctx (If t1 t2 t3) = case (inferType ctx t1, inferType ctx t2, inferType ctx t3) of
      (Just BoolT, Just ty2, Just ty3) -> 
        if ty2 = ty3 
        then Just ty2
        else Nothing
      _ -> Nothing
}}}

could be rewritten using pattern families as:

{{{
    -- Here ‘Inf’ is a family indexed by ‘ctx’
    pattern Inf ctx ty <- (inferType ctx -> Just ty)

    inferType ctx (If (Inf ctx BoolT) (Inf ctx ty1) (Inf ctx ty2))
       | ty1 == ty2 = Just ty1
    inferType ctx If{} = Nothing
}}} 

allowing the user to pattern match ''directly'' on the inferable types without manually checking for `Just`s. This could currently be written using view patterns as:

{{{
    inferType ctx (If (inferType ctx -> Just BoolT) (inferType ctx -> Just ty1) (inferType ctx -> Just ty2))
       | ty1 == ty2 = Just ty1
    inferType ctx If{} = Nothing
}}}

which is longer and clunkier, especially since the user is forced to deal with `Just`s again.

=== More advanced examples: Regular expressions ===
Given a regular expression operator `(~=) :: String -> String -> Maybe [String]` we can define a pattern:

{{{
    pattern Match x regexp <- ((~= regexp) -> Just x)
}}}

where `regexp` is indexes the `Match` pattern family:

{{{
    firstWord (Match words "[a-zA-Z]+") = words
    firstWord _                         = error "No words found"
}}}

or

{{{
    vowels (Match vwls "[aeiou]") = length vwls
}}}

One can also define it as an operator:

{{{
    pattern x :~= regexp ((~= regexp) -> Just x)
}}}
