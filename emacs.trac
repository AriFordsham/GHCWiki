= Emacs tips and tricks

Most of us use Emacs for GHC development. This page lists various Emacs configuration tips and tricks used by GHC developers. It is meant to be self-contained, so that you can grab relevant piece of configuration, put it into your config file and benefit from it instantly. The only exception are two larger extensions for Emacs (haskell-mode and ghc-mod), where we direct you to external installation instructions and tutorials.

Each entry includes a short description and instruction how to enable given setting (if it contains only a block of lisp code it means you need to add it to your `.emacs` configuration file). All configuration is given for Emacs 24, unless otherwise noted. 

It is assumed that you know how to install packages in Emacs (e.g. with ELPA). ''TODO: Let's not assume it. Can we create a saction "Installing extensions with ELPA" and give a short introduction on using it? I admit I don't remember how to use ELPA and would have to google it - JS.''

= General

== IDO mode

'''Description''': IDO stands for Interactively Do Things and it greatly improves file opening and switching between buffers. When opening a file it shows list of files and directories in current directory, allows to navigate the directory tree in an easy manner, provides intuitive filtering capabilities and allows to select a file by selecting its name using arrow keys. Similar behaviour is provided when switching between opened buffers. A nice introductory tutorial to IDO can be found [http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/10/10/introduction-to-ido-mode/ here].

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)
(setq ido-everywhere t)
(ido-mode 1)
}}}

== Disable tabs for indentation

'''Description''': We used to use tabs for indentation, but now we aim to have no tabs in the source code. There is a hook that will prevent you from pushing tabs into repository (unless file already contained tabs). This setting will prevent you from introducing tabs in the source code.

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
}}}

== Highlight text beyond 80th column

'''Description''': If you have a tendency to write too long lines of code this will help you by highlighting text beyond 80th column.

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(require 'whitespace)
(setq whitespace-style '(face lines-tail))
(setq whitespace-line-column 80)
(global-whitespace-mode t)
}}}

== Automatically removes trailing whitespaces when file is saved

'''Description''': Currently source code of GHC contains lots of trailing whitespaces, which means that '''this setting is dangerous'''. It will remove ALL trailing whitespaces in every file that you edit, so you might have one or two lines changed by you and a hundred lines automatically changed by removing trailing whitespaces. This will require you to separate whitespaces into a separate commit by using `git add -i`. This is tedious, so be warned.

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
}}}

''TODO: describe how to enable this setting only if the file was already free of trailing-whitespaces at load-time''

== Highlight trailing whitespaces

'''Description''': Automatic removal of trailing whitespaces described above can be a bit inconvenient to use. One of the alternative approaches to problem of trailing whitespaces is making them visible, so that you notice when you accidentally introduce them into a file. You will also see already existing trailing whitespaces. For more details see [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Useless-Whitespace.html Useless Whitespace] section of Emacs documentation.

'''How to enable''':

{{{#!elisp
(setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t)
(setq-default indicate-empty-lines t)
}}}

== Kill whole line and newline with C-k if at beginning of line

'''Description''': IF you place cursor at the beginning of line, the default behaviour of C-k is to fill all text until newline, but not the newline itself. You need to type C-k again to remove that newline. This setting allows to avoid typing `C-k` twice by killing all text until the newline and newline itself (but only when cursor is placed at the beginning of a line).

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(setq kill-whole-line t)
}}}

== Toggle line number display

'''Description''': Allows you to toggle line number display with F11. For those who like to see line numbers at the beginning of each line.

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(global-set-key (kbd "<f11>") 'global-linum-mode)
}}}

== Always display column number in mode line

'''Description''': By default Emacs only displays line number in the mode line. This setting adds column number.

'''How to enable''':
{{{#!elisp 
(column-number-mode 1)
}}}

== Switch between windows with Alt-<window number>

'''Description''': Enhances switching between multiple windows. To switch to another window use pressing Alt-<window number>. Number of each window is displayed in red in the mode line.

'''How to enable''':
You need to install package `window-number` and add this to your configuration:
{{{
(require 'window-number)
(window-number-mode)
(window-number-meta-mode)
}}}

== Cycle buffer

''Will add this later''

= Haskell-specific

== Haskell mode

'''Description''': Haskell mode is a major mode for Emacs. Major features include syntax highlighting, GHCi integration and automatic indentation.

'''How to enable''': See installation instructions on [https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode github] and [http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/latest/ manual].

== ghc-mod

'''Description''': ''I'm not using this one. Can someone (Kazu?) complete this section?''

'''How to enable''': See installation instructions [http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/ghc-mod/en/ here]

== Hask-tags
