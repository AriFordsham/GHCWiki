= Welcome to the GHC Developer Wiki

This is the home for GHC developers. If you're only interested in using GHC,
then you probably want ​the [[http://www.haskell.org/ghc|GHC home page]]. If you are an aspiring GHC developer,
and just want to get started, read the [[Newcomers|Newcomers page]] (which is always in the
sidebar under "Joining in").

== Please help improve the GHC developer's wiki

Please help us improve the information on the GHC developer's wiki. You can easily do this by editing the wiki directly. Just [[https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/register|register]] an account, and then edit away. Alternatively, [[https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/login|log in]] as user **guest** with password **guest** (but we'd prefer you to create an account, because it enables us to contact you if necessary). The [[https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TracGuide|Help/Guide]] link at the top of every page gives a good description of the markup language and how to use Trac in general.
