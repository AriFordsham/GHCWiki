= Harbormaster: continuous integration & patch building for GHC =

When **you use Arcanist to submit a diff**, Phabricator will automatically trigger a build rule using an application called "Harbormaster". This application causes a build machine in the background to apply your patch and run `sh ./validate`. Afterwords, your diff will be updated with a status from Harbormaster about the build, including links to build logs and testsuite results.

The current status of the build is at the top. Phab:D162 is a good example:

Click on the link posted by Harbormaster (in this case, "Harbormaster completed building B467: Diff 379") to the build to go to the Buildable, like Phab:B467 in this case. There you can follow links to individual builds, containing stdout/stderr logs, like https://phabricator.haskell.org/harbormaster/build/468/

Note that every time you run `arc diff` and update an existing review or create a new one, you'll trigger a build.

Harbormaster also builds GHC commits that have been pushed. You can see more on the [https://phabricator.haskell.org/harbormaster Harbormaster] application.

**Note**: You can use the word "[ci skip]" by itself in the commit when you submit a diff or push something to skip builds. You may want to do this if you know your build will break, but you just want to post code.

== Navigating the application UI ==

However, it's also useful to understand the application UI as well, so you can look through (or search for) previous builds.

First, go to https://phabricator.haskell.org/harbormaster, the top-level application. Here, you can see a list of all the latest builds; for example -
