= Mailing lists and IRC =

GHC developers hang out on the [http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-devs ghc-devs mailing list].


There is also [http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-tickets ghc-tickets], which receives a copy of traffic from the bug tracker, and [http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-commits ghc-commits], which receives a copy of all commit messages.

The traffic levels vary quite a bit depending on how much activity there is.

== IRC ==

GHC developers also hang out on {{{#ghc}}} channel on [http://freenode.net/ FreeNode]. This is a good place to ask questions related to working on GHC itself; if you have more general questions then {{{#haskell}}} is probably more appropriate.
