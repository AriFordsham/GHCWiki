

As of 7.10, GHC has basic functionality to generate DWARF-compliant
debugging information with its binaries. This opens up a completely
new way of debugging or profiling Haskell programs: Instead of
instrumenting the program or the runtime system, we "simply" teach
standard debugging tools to make sense of a running Haskell program.
This means that we gain debugging and profiling capabilities in
situations where existing profiling approaches could not help us, such
as for crashes or code that we cannot meaningfully instrument.

There are a few caveats to this method. Firstly, GHC optimisations can
be very aggressive in reorganizing the code and avoiding redundancies
at runtime. This means that even with good heuristics, there will be
situations where information is lost. On the other hand, DWARF-based
debugging tools also make assumptions about the code that are more
geared towards C-like languages, and get confused for Haskell programs.

Bottom line: While the infrastructure should be perfectly stable and
safe to use, inspecting Haskell programs like this is still very much
"wild west". Having a good working knowledge of low-level Haskell
execution is definetely a good idea. We hope that some experience will
help us improve the situation.

== Basic Set-Up

To keep things simple for the moment, let's say we compile the
tried-and-true `fib`:
{{{
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
main :: IO ()
main = putStrln $ fib 20
}}}

Just like with GCC, the "magic" command line flag here is `-g`. This
causes GHC to generate DWARF sections into produced binaries:
{{{
ghc -O -g -rtsopts fib.hs
}}}

For Mac Os, debug information is actually kept separate from the
binary, so we first have to package it using `dsymutil` at this point:
{{{
dsymutil fib
}}}

If we want, we can now check that DWARF information was generated
correctly using `objdump` or `dwarfdump` respectively:
{{{
[Linux] objdump -Wi fib
[MacOs] dwarfdump fib.dSYM
}}}

Either should show us something of the form:
{{{
TAG_compile_unit [1] *
 AT_name( "fib.hs" )
 AT_producer( "The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System 7.9.20141217" )
 AT_language( DW_LANG_Haskell )
}}}

Which tells us that we have DWARF information about the compilation
unit `fib.hs`. Note that the Haskell language ID `0x18` is not
recognized by all tools yet, so you might see an "Unknown" there
instead.

It is important to realize that - in contrast to instrumentation -
adding DWARF debug information does not actually change the executable
sections of the executable. In fact, we can strip them without
changing the performance characteristics of the program at all:
{{{
$ cp fib fib_stripped
$ strip fib_stripped
$ time ./fib
1134903170

real	0m13.171s
user	0m13.160s
sys	0m0.001s
$ time ./fib_stripped
1134903170

real	0m13.179s
user	0m13.168s
sys	0m0.000s
$ 
}}}

This is a very good property in certain situations - DWARF information
is simply painless to add and throw away. Furthermore, we can now
profile code and always be sure that the measurements actually reflect
real-life performance.

== Debugging

At this point, we can simply invoke `gdb` and set breakpoints (TODO -
doesn't work on Mac yet):
{{{
gdb -q fib
Reading symbols fib...done.
(gdb) break fib.hs:3
Breakpoint 1 at 0x403d98: file fib.hs, line 3.
(gdb) run +RTS -V0
Starting program: fib +RTS -V0

Breakpoint 1, Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:3
3	fib 1 = 1
(gdb) 
}}}

At this point we have actually stopped the Haskell program at the
given line. We can now step a bit further to see the program working
its magic:
{{{
(gdb) s
Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:4
4	fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
(gdb) s
Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:2
2	fib 0 = 0
(gdb) s
c3Vy_info () at fib.hs:4
4	fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
(gdb) s
Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:2
2	fib 0 = 0
(gdb) s

Breakpoint 1, Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:3
3	fib 1 = 1
(gdb) s
c3Vy_info () at fib.hs:4
4	fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
(gdb)
}}}

Note that passing `+RTS -V0` as we did above is necessary for this to
work, as otherwise we would end up stepping into the RTS timer.

Furthermore, we can back-trace to get an idea of where we were coming
from:
{{{
(gdb) bt
#0  c3Vy_info () at fib.hs:4
#1  0x0000000000403de0 in Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:2
          [...]
#17 0x0000000000403de0 in Main_zdwfib_info () at fib.hs:2
#18 0x0000000000403e98 in Main_main2_info () at libraries/base/GHC/Show.hs:145
#19 0x0000000000481aa0 in ccNI_info () at libraries/base/GHC/IO/Handle/Text.hs:603
#20 0x000000000067d968 in ?? () at rts/Exception.cmm:332
#21 0x0000000000682530 in ?? ()
Backtrace stopped: previous frame identical to this frame (corrupt stack?)
(gdb) info symbol 0x000000000067d968
stg_catch_frame_info in section .text of /home/cserv1_a/soc_pg/scpmw/leeds/tests/haskell/fib/fib
(gdb) info symbol 0x0000000000682530
stg_stop_thread_info in section .text of /home/cserv1_a/soc_pg/scpmw/leeds/tests/haskell/fib/fib
}}}

The stack trace you get at this point might look a bit different - to
get the above result you will need to compile both libraries and the
runtime system with debugging support (`GhcRtsHcOpts += -g` and
`GhcLibHcOpts += -g`).

Let us have a closer look at the stack:

- First we have a number of return closures to our `fib`
  function. That the stack is so "clean" means that we have no lazy
  evaluation going on, which in this example is a result of compiling
  with optimisations above (`-O`). Perhaps unintuitively, simple
  optimisations often have a beneficial effect on stack trace clarity.

- On the other hand, we see that we have no reference to the `main`
  function any more. In fact, the stack only references `show` and
  `putStrLn` respectively, which is what `print` unfolds to. Here GHC
  figured out that it can tail-call, causing a "hole" in our stack
  trace.

- Finally, the two last frames are RTS frames, corresponding to
  `stg_catch_frame` (the top-level exception handler) and
  `stg_stop_thread`, which is the stack frame handling returning the
  thread to the RTS. This is where the debugger runs out of guidance
  from the DWARF information and complains with "corrupt stack?"
  error.

== Profiling

Another application of DWARF information is that we can use low-level
profiling to map performance data to source code. On Linux, we can use
the `perf` utility to gather and annotate such data, for example:
{{{
$ perf record ./fib
1134903170
[ perf record: Woken up 9 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 2.027 MB perf.data (~88582 samples) ]
$ perf annotate
}}}

This yields us a profiling view that looks as follows:
{{{
       │    0000000000403de0 <c3Vl_info>:
       │    fib :: Int -> Int
       │    fib 0 = 0
       │    fib 1 = 1
       │    fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
 37.96 │      movq   $0x403e10,0x0(%rbp)
 43.54 │      mov    0x8(%rbp),%rax
  5.09 │      lea    -0x2(%rax),%r14
  2.38 │      mov    %rbx,0x8(%rbp)
 11.03 │    ↓ jmpq   ffffffffffffffff
       │      nop
       │      add    %al,(%r8) 
       │      add    %al,(%rax)
}}}

Note that due to DWARF information, `perf` has managed to locate the
source code that belongs to the "hot" assembler code.

== Open Issues

The example should give an idea of the potential we have
here. Unfortunately, it is still quite easy to run into
show-stoppers. The following list shows the most pressing issues on
the way to truly "supporting" DWARF-based debugging:

Debugger problems - these could go away by either patching the used
debugging tools or replacing them with our own:

- Note that both `perf` as well as `gdb` refer to blocks using their
  backend names (e.g. `c3Vl_info`). This is not GHC's fault - we
  correctly set the `DW_AT_name` for `DW_TAG_subprogram` records. The
  current state of investigation is that debugging tools seemingly
  prefer to use language-dependent "unmangling" of symbol names. We
  probably will have to patch these programs to do something sensible
  for Haskell code.

- Furthermore, the symbol names in `gbd`'s backtrace are actually
  wrong -- notice the `??` entries. On the other hand, note that `info
  symbol` still gives us the right answer. What is actually happening
  here is that `gdb` looks up the symbol with an offset of 1, as that
  makes sense for C-like programs (see `[Note: Info Offset]` in
  `compiler/nativeGen/Dwarf/Types.hs` for details). This is another
  thing we probably have to patch out.

- While it is possible to use `perf`, it seems to cope rather badly
  with the fragmented nature of Haskell code. Furthermore, the
  fine-grained performance data it produces do not always sync up well
  with high-level Haskell code. It might be a better idea to map
  performance to Core instead - or maybe we could, again, contribute
  to `perf` so it learns to represent Haskell programs better.

- Currently debugging seems to not work at all on Mac Os - both `gdb`
  and `lldb` seem to simply crash once you set breakpoints. Possibly
  something overwriting info tables? Investigation necessary.

Runtime problems - can probably be fixed by using Haskell-specific
tools and/or improving infrastructure further:

- When trying to look at stack traces, there are two characteristics
  of Haskell code that give us a hard time. The first one is that
  tail-calls are very common, and not entirely straight-forward to
  prevent. This is significant, because sometimes we positively want
  to know whether a certain function is on the stack frame or not.
  Arash Hourani has been working on a way to implement
  `forceStackFrame`, hopefully we'll have something like that
  eventually.

- The second issue is lazy evaluation. A thunk update will be
  represented as a rather non-descript `update_frame` stack
  closure. There has also been experimental work at retaining enough
  information to make this more useful.

- Furthermore, we have the conceptual problem that with optimisations
  it becomes hard to pin-point "the" source tick to associate with a
  code location. Because of the prevalence of in-lining in Haskell
  code, using the most "low-level" source link would make the system
  almost entirely useless - we would essentially be looking at
  variants of `$`, `.` and `>>=` all the time. Instead, we look for
  the most specific source note that belongs to the currently compiled
  compilation unit. This heuristic works quite well, but it is not
  hard to demonstrate situations where it goes wrong.

Architectural problems - might need us to re-think our infrastructure
a bit:

- While this sort of debugging does not *require* all libraries and
  RTS to be built with `-g`, it certainly is a very good idea. After
  all, currently stack unwinding stops at the first closure that
  doesn't have DWARF information associated with it. As Johan Tibell
  suggested, the best approach might be to look at options to
  implement `-gsplit-dwarf`, which would allow us to ship a DWARF
  package separately.

  (Also note that tools with more knowledge about the Haskell stack
  can work around this issue somewhat by using info tables to traverse
  the Haskell stack. Explaining this strategy to DWARF readers might
  also be possible, Nathan Howell had done some experiments on this.)

- Implementing our own tools depends on our ability to read binaries
  and the contained DWARF information. So far we have used `libdwarf`,
  but this looks like it could become a portability disaster (no Mac
  support, most Linux distros ship it in a state we can't
  use). Possibly use `libbfd` with a custom-built DWARF reader?

- Windows situation completely unclear.
