This is Joachim’s notepad about his plans to get rid of dynamic arity checks in the generated code (and hence also things like PAPs).

## Status quo


Core is a language where function types to not carry arity information (`Int→Int→Int` could be a binary function return `Int`, or a unary function returning `Int→Int`).


In STG, functions do have an arity, and calls to known functions are efficient in that they use the right calling convention. But because there is no type system any more, when we generate code for a call with, say, two arguments to an unknown function, the code has to handle the case of unary functions (putting one argument to the stack), binary functions (jumping right to them) or higher-arity functions (creating a PAP closure). This code is commoned up in commonly used code `stg_ap_pp_fast`, but even in the best case, there are two jumps involved.


Assume this code could simply rely on the function behind the pointer expecting two arguments, then we could get rid of the indirection via `stg_ap_pp_fast` and just jump there.

## Is it worth it


Before going in the how, the question is: Is it worth it?


Here is a micro benchmark:

```
-- Foo.hsmoduleFoowherefoo::(Int->Int->Int)->Intfoo f = go 00where go a 999999999= a
        go a n = a `seq` go (f a n)(n+1){-# NOINLINE foo #-}-- Main.hsimportFoofun::Int->Int->Intfun x y =(x*x)+(y*y)main= print $ foo fun
```


I compiled this:

```
$ ghc -O -c -keep-s-files Foo.hs
$ ghc -O -c -keep-s-files Main.hs
$ ghc -O Foo.o Main.o -o test-slow
$ vim Foo.s # see below
$ ghc -c -O Foo.s
$ ghc -O Foo.o Main.o -o test-fast
```


In the edit step, I replaced

```
movq%rbx,%rdxmovq%rax,%rbxmovq%rdx,-16(%rbp)movq%rcx,-8(%rbp)addq$-24,%rbpjmpstg_ap_pp_fast.sizes1F8_info,.-s1F8_info
```


with

```
movq%rbx,%rdxmovq%rax,%rbxmovq%rdx,-16(%rbp)movq%rcx,-8(%rbp)addq$-24,%rbpjmp*-2(%rax).sizes1F8_info,.-s1F8_info
```


(yes, that works!)


Then I timed the resulting binaries (`python -m timeit -n 10 -r 3 'import os; os.system("./test-fast")';` and found that the change improves runtime by …(waiting)…
