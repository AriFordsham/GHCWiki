= Unpacked sum types =

This page explains the motivation and implementation of unpacking for sum types.

See also [wiki:UnliftedDataTypes]

== Motivation ==

GHC does a good job of unpacking product types. Given a declaration like

{{{
data T1 a b = C1 a b
data T2 a b = C2 {-# UNPACK #-} !(T1 a b)
}}}

`C2` will have a representation where all the overhead of the `C1` constructor, both the pointer to it in the `C2` constructor and the info table pointer in the `C1` constructor, has been removed. This saves two words and one indirection  compared to a packed representation, which uses five words.

Unfortunately, a similar example using sum types cannot be unpacked today:

{{{
data T1 a = Some a | None
data T2 a = C !(T1 a)  -- Cannot UNPACK here
}}}

Here the representation of the `C` constructor will contain a pointer to e.g. the `Some` constructor. The `Some` constructor will be a separate heap object and thus needs one word to store its info table pointer.

In this example there is an alternative, unpacked representation that is more memory efficient and has fewer indirections. We could store a constructor tag together with the union of the fields of `T1` inside `C`. Conceptually the memory layout would look like this (in practice we might group pointer and non-pointer fields together):

|| T2 info table pointer || T1 constructor tag || Fields of `Some` || Fields of `None` ||

(In this case `None` has no fields.)

This representation saves one word and one indirection compared to the packed representation, which uses four words.

== Source language design ==

We add new built-in types for anonymous sums, and for anonymous unboxed sums.  These are directly analogous to the existing anonymous tuples (in Haskell) and anonymous unboxed tuples (a GHC extension).  Specifically:

* A new language extension `AnonymousSums`.

* We add a family of new built-in '''type constructors''' for sums and unboxed sums:
{{{
(|),   (||),   (|||),   (||||), etc
(#|#), (#||#), (#|||#), (#||||#), etc
}}}
  A sum of n "|"s is a n+1 ary sum.  (Just like tuples `(,)`, `(,,)`, etc.)

* Each n-ary-sum type constructor comes with n '''data constructors''', with systematically-derived names, thus:
{{{
data (||) a b c = (_||) a
                | (|_|) b
                | (||_) c
}}}
  and similarly for unboxed sums.  The `_` indicates with disjunct of the sum we mean.

* You use the type constructor in a distfix way, not just prefix, like so:
{{{
(Int | Bool)          means   (|) Int Bool
(Int | Bool | Int)    means   (||) Int Bool Int
(# Int | Bool #)      means   (#|#) Int Bool
}}}
  And similarly the data constructors:
{{{
(| True)     means   (|_) True
(#| 'c' |#)  means   (#|_|#) 'c'
}}}

* You can use the data constructors both in terms (to construct) and in patterns (to decompose).  For patterns, illustrating both prefix and distfix forms:
{{{
case x of
    (#| x ||#) -> ...   -- Distrix
    (#_|||#) y -> ...   -- Prefix
    ...two more disjuncts needed to be exhaustive
}}}

* Anonymous sums, both boxed and unboxed, are first class values. They can be passed as an argument to a function, returned as its result, be the type of a data constructor field, and so on.  Of course, unboxed sums are unlifted (cannot be bottom), and should be represented efficiently (more on that below).

* Just as for tuples:
  * The components of a boxed sum type must be of kind `*`.  For example `(Int|Bool)` is fine, but `(Int#|Bool)` is not.
  * The components of an unboxed sum type may be of kind `*` or `#`.  So `(# Int# | Bool #)` is fine.  And you can nest unboxed sums and tuple arbitrarily, e.g.
    * `(# (# Int,Bool #) | Char# #)`
    * `(# (# Int# | Char # #) | Int #)`

`All` of these rules follow the same pattern as the rules for boxed/unboxed tuples.


=== Design questions ===

1. The expression `(x ||)` could mean:
 * The same as `(_||)`, namely injecting `x` into the first disjunct of a 3-way sum.
 * An operator section meaning `( (||) x )`.

 Similarly `(|| x)`.

 Which should we choose?  Simon PJ thinks the first (i.e steal the existing syntax). (Note that there's also stolen syntax around any operators `(|#)` and `(#|)`, as well as type operators such as `(|||)` and `(#|#)`.)

2. For large-arity anonymous sums, the data constructor syntax requires counting vertical bars. This is annoying. Might we consider switching to a new syntax where `(0 of 3 | x)` means `(x | | )` and `(2 of 6 | y)` means `( | | y | | | )`? I (Richard) saw this syntax in an email and thought it might be an improvement.

----------------------------------
== Implementation ==

== Wired-in types ==

Boxed and unboxed sums get implemented very like boxed and unboxed tuples; see [[GhcFile(compiler/prelude/TysWiredIn.hs)]].

== The Core language == 

There are no changes to Core!  (Apart from the above new built-in type constructors.)

=== Core to STG ===

When going to STG we need to eliminate the unboxed sums. This can be done in [[GhcFile(compiler/simplStg/UnariseStg.hs)]], just like for tuples.

Given the Core function

{{{
f :: (# t_1 | ... | t_n #) -> ...
}}}

we convert it to a call to STG which includes the tag and the maximum number of pointer and non-pointer arguments we might need. Example:

||= Core =||||= STG =||
|| {{{ f :: (# Int# | Bool #) -> ... }}} || {{{ f :: Word -> Word -> Pointer -> ... }}} ||
|| {{{ f :: (# Int# | Word# #) -> ... }}} || {{{ f :: Word -> Word -> ... }}} ||

=== Code generation ===

We need to make sure we generate closure types for the constructors we unpack into. This is done in [[GhcFile(compiler/codeGen/StgCmmCon.hs)]].

We use the same algorithm as is used in the Core to STG step to compute the maximum number of pointer and non-pointer fields we might need.

=== Unpacking ===

Given

{{{
data T1 a = Some a | None
data T2 a = C {-# UNPACK #-} !(T1 a)
}}}

we generate a "worker" constructor

{{{
C (# a | (# #) #)
}}}

(`(# #)` playing the role of void.)

We then translate the construction of `C` as follows:

{{{
C x

===> (translates to)

case x of
    Some y -> C (# y | #)
    None   -> C (# | (# #) #)
}}}

We then translate the elimination of `C` as follows:

{{{
case e of
    C x -> ... x ...

===> (translates to)

case e of
    C x' ->
        let x = case x' of
            (# y | #) -> Some y
            (# | _ #) -> None
        in ... x ...
}}}

This above reboxing will go away, using case-of-case and case-of-known-constructor, if we scrutinize `x` again.

-------------------------
= Exploiting nullary constructors =

Joachim [https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2015-September/009831.html writes]: The current proposed layout for a 
{{{
    data D a = D a {-# UNPACK #-} !(Maybe a) would be
    [D’s pointer] [a] [tag (0 or 1)] [Just’s a]
}}}
So the representation of
{{{
         D foo (Just bar)     is     [D_info] [&foo] [1] [&bar]
and of   D foo Nothing        is     [D_info] [&foo] [0] [&dummy]
}}}
where `dummy` is something that makes the GC happy.

But assuming this dummy object is something that is never a valid heap objects of its own, then this should be sufficient to distinguish the two cases, and we could actually have that the representation of 
{{{
         D foo (Just bar)     is     [D_info] [&foo] [&bar]
and of   D foo Nothing        is     [D_info] [&foo] [&dummy]
}}}
and an case analysis on D would compare the pointer in the third word with the well-known address of dummy to determine if we have Nothing or Just. This saves one word.


If we generate a number of such static dummy objects, we can generalize this tag-field avoiding trick to other data types than Maybe. It seems that it is worth doing that if
 * the number of constructors is no more than the number of static dummy objects, and
 * there is one constructor which has more pointer fields than all other constructors.

Also, this trick cannot be applied repeatedly: If we have
{{{
  data D = D {-# UNPACK #-} !(Maybe a) | D'Nothing
  data E = E {-# UNPACK #-} !(D a)
}}}
then it cannot be applied when unpacking `D` into `E`. (Or maybe it can, but care has to be taken that `D`’s `Nothing` is represented by a different dummy object than `Maybe`’s `Nothing`.)

Anyways, this is an optimization that can be implemented once unboxed sum type are finished and working reliably.
