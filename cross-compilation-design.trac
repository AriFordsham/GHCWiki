There are several people now interested in working on turning GHC into a Real Cross Compiler (something akin to the design laid out [wiki:CrossCompilation here].) This page covers that WIP, as well as architectural/design notes.

= Current work = 
 * Brian Bloniarz implemented a cross compilation mode for hsc2hs. You can find the patches [http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-ghc/2010-December/058508.html here]. These have yet to be merged by GHC HQ, but we would like them to be!
 * Dan Knapp is working on the native code generators - removing everything that uses the pre-processor and instead threading an `Architecture` type through the compiler, containing ABI information so we can generate the correct code at runtime. You can check out his work by doing

   }}}

= Other things worth considering/need doing/questions =
 * The build system. This is the Big Mother - the design is laid out [wiki:Building/Architecture here]. There are various things worth considering, like the fact that GHC builds programs as part of the build routine which it then uses, etc.
 * Will the RTS need modifications? We must build it multiple times with both the host and target toolchain C compilers, so it should mostly be OK, but we may need to do more
