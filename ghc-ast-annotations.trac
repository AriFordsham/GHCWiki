= This is a proposal / discussion page for adding annotations to the AST, for ticket #9628 =




Right now the locations of syntactic markers such as `do`/`let`/`where`/`in`/`of` in the source are discarded from the AST, although they are retained in the rich token stream.

The `haskell-src-exts` package deals with this by means of using the [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-exts-1.15.0.1/docs/Language-Haskell-Exts-SrcLoc.html#t:SrcSpanInfo `SrcSpanInfo`] data type which contains the SrcSpan as per the current GHC Located type but also has a list of `SrcSpan`s for the  syntactic markers, depending on the particular AST fragment being annotated.

In addition, the annotation type is provided as a parameter to the AST, so that it can be changed as required, see [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-exts-1.15.0.1/docs/Language-Haskell-Exts-Annotated-Syntax.html#t:Annotated here].

The motivation for this change is then

1. Simplify the roundtripping and modification of source by explicitly capturing the missing location information for the syntactic markers.

2. Allow the annotation to be a parameter so that it can be replaced with a different one in tools, for example HaRe would include the tokens for the AST fragment leaves.

3. Aim for some level compatibility with haskell-src-exts so that tools developed for it could be easily ported to GHC, for example [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-exts-1.15.0.1/docs/Language-Haskell-Exts-Annotated-ExactPrint.html#v:exactPrint exactPrint].

4. Allow simple round-tripping of code via a GHC variant of [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hindent hindent]

5. There is a strong motivation for the annotation to be / support Functor [http://www.davidchristiansen.dk/2014/09/06/pretty-printing-idris/ here] for the idris IDE support

== Richard Eisenberg response ==

For what it's worth, my thought is not to use SrcSpanInfo (which, to me, is the wrong way to slice the abstraction) but instead to add SrcSpan fields to the relevant nodes. For example:
{{{
#!haskell

  | HsDo        SrcSpan              -- of the word "do"
                BlockSrcSpans
                (HsStmtContext Name) -- The parameterisation is unimportant
                                     -- because in this context we never use
                                     -- the PatGuard or ParStmt variant
                [ExprLStmt id]       -- "do":one or more stmts
                PostTcType           -- Type of the whole expression

...

data BlockSrcSpans = LayoutBlock Int  -- the parameter is the indentation level
                                 ...  -- stuff to track the appearance of any semicolons
                   | BracesBlock ...  -- stuff to track the braces and semicolons
}}}

The way I understand it, the SrcSpanInfo proposal means that we would have lots of empty SrcSpanInfos, no? Most interior nodes don't need one, I think.

Popping up a level, I do support the idea of including this info in the AST.

== SPJ response to concern re extra noise in AST ==

 I thiink the key question is whether it is acceptable to sprinkle this kind of information throughout the AST. For someone interested in source-to-source conversions (like me) this is great, others may find it intrusive.

Itâ€™s probably not too bad if you use record syntax; thus

{{{
#!haskell
  | HsDo  { hsdo_do_loc :: SrcSpan              -- of the word "do"
          , hsdo_blocks :: BlockSrcSpans
          , hsdo_ctxt   :: HsStmtContext Name
          , hsdo_stmts  :: [ExprLStmt id]
          , hsdo_type    :: PostTcType }

}}} 

== Other issues ==

The AST is initially created by the parser, and then changed through the renamer and type checker.

From a source to source conversion perspective the `ParsedSource` is closest to the original source code, as it respects the original linear ordering of the declarations, which are each wrapped in an appropriate constructor from `HsDecl`.

The `RenamedSource` gathers all the like declarations together, and strips out the `HsDecl`, as well as re-ordering binds to appear in dependency order.

The `TypeCheckedSource` further changes the `RenamedSource` to replace the original type information with the calculated types.

So manipulations need to happen at the `ParsedSource` level, but with the ability to query information from the `RenamedSource` or `TypecheckedSource` as required.

At the moment HaRe manages this by building up a token tree indexed by SrcSpan with tokens at the leaves, constructed from the `ParsedSource`, and then indexes into it for changes based on the `RenamedSource`.  The token tree is fiddly and brittle, so it would be better to keep this information directy in the AST.

== Abortive annotation parameter attempt ==

[https://phabricator.haskell.org/D246 D246] captures an attempt to work through a type parameter. This exploded in complexity, and was abandoned.

== SPJ alternative suggestion ==

    Another way to tackle this would be to ensure that syntax tree nodes have a "node-key" (a bit like their source location) that clients could use in a finite map, to map node-key to values of their choice.

An initial investigation shows some complexity blow up too.  The same effect can be achieved with a virtual node key.

== AZ Virtual node key proposal ==

Instead of physically placing a "node-key" in each AST Node, a virtual
node key can be generated from any `GenLocated SrcSpan e' comprising a
combination of the `SrcSpan` value and a unique identifier from the
constructor for `e`, perhaps using its `TypeRep`, since the entire AST
derives Typeable.

To further reduce the intrusiveness, a base Annotation type can be
defined that captures the location of noise tokens for each AST
constructor. This can then be emitted from the parser, if the
appropriate flag is set to enable it.

So

{{{
#!haskell

    data ApiAnnKey = AK SrcSpan TypeRep

    mkApiAnnKey :: (Located e) -> ApiAnnKey
    mkApiAnnKey = ...

    data Ann =
      ....
      | AnnHsLet    SrcSpan -- of the word "let"
                    SrcSpan -- of the word "in"

      | AnnHsDo     SrcSpan -- of the word "do"
}}}

And then in the parser

{{{
#!haskell

        | 'let' binds 'in' exp   { mkAnnHsLet $1 $3 (LL $ HsLet (unLoc $2) $4) }
}}}

The helper is

{{{
#!haskell

    mkAnnHsLet :: Located a -> Located b -> LHsExpr RdrName -> P (LHsExpr RdrName)
    mkAnnHsLet (L l_let _) (L l_in _) e = do
      addAnnotation (mkAnnKey e) (AnnHsLet l_let l_in)
      return e;
}}}

The Parse Monad would have to accumulate the annotations to be
returned at the end, if called with the appropriate flag.

There will be some boilerplate in getting the annotations and helper
functions defined, but it will not pollute the rest.

This technique can also potentially be backported to support older GHC
versions via a modification to ghc-parser[1].
