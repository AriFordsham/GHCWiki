= GHC Darcs Repositories =

This page lists the active darcs repositories relating to GHC.  For instructions on actually getting a GHC source tree, see [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources].

== The HEAD ==

The Master List of repositories is in the file [http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc/packages $(TOP)/packages].  It is authoritative.  Everything else in this sub-section may be out of date, although it gives the right general idea.

These darcs repositories are the HEAD (main trunk) of GHC development:

||[http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc]||The main GHC repository||
||[http://darcs.haskell.org/testsuite]||The test suite (requires python 2.4+) ||
||[http://darcs.haskell.org/nofib]||The benchmark suite||

For faster fetching, try the {{{--hashed}} mirrors at [http://darcs.volkswurst.de/ghc], [http://darcs.volkswurst.de/testsuite], etc. (updated every two hours). Note that this only works with darcs2 clients, but contains exactly the same (darcs1) patches as the official repository at the time it was mirrored.

'''Warning.'''  Both the `ghc` and `testsuite` repositories tickle a case-sensitivity bug in darcs, so on Windows (only) you can't do a full `darcs get` for `ghc` or `testsuite`.  Instead, either start with a tarball of the repository gotten from somewhere else, or do `darcs get --partial`.  (The repository itself can't be fixed to avoid the bug, without messing up its history.)

The following repositories are the "GHC boot" libraries, i.e. the set of libraries that are necessary to build GHC (i.e. they are used when building the stage 2 compiler). They populate the libraries/ directory of a GHC tree.

== Branches ==

The following branches are active:

 '''6.10 Branch'''::
  Prepend `ghc-6.10` to the name of the repository to get the 6.10 branch.  For example,
  the 6.10 ghc repository is at [http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc-6.10/ghc]. 
  [[br]][[br]]
  Note: only the `ghc` repository and the core libraries were branched for 6.10, the
  extralibs packages were not. However, there are symlinks under `ghc-6.10`.
  The `darcs-all` script knows
  where to get everything, so you don't have to worry about this, just follow the
  instructions in [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources].
