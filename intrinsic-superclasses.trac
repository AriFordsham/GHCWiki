== The Problem ==

Sometimes we want to refactor the type class hierarchy, and it always hurts. The typical scenario is that we have a library class
{{{
class C x where
  f :: ...
  g :: ...
}}}
but then realise that `C` is the "has `g`" special case of a useful general notion `S`, so we would really prefer to have had the library supply
{{{
class S x where
  f :: ...
class S x => C x where
  g :: ...
}}}
The cost of the generalization is that all our old `C` instances must be split into a `C` and an `S`. Client code breaks all over the place and people complain bitterly. This is the reason to resist making `Functor` and `Applicative` superclasses of `Monad`. It would have been pleasant to introduce `Applicative` as a generalization of `Monad` and somehow have all our old `Monad` instances generate `Applicative` instances too.

'''Requirement 1''' It should somehow be possible for an instance definition in source code to generate more than one instance internally.

However, the problem deepens. What if we actually had
{{{
class C x where
  f :: ...
  f =  ...g...
  g :: ...
}}}
to start with? That is, types with a `C` instance can be given an `S` instance in a "standard" way, but there are other types which have `S` instances defined differently and no `C` instance at all. Again, that is a familiar situation: every `Monad` has is `Applicative` with `(<*>) = ap`, but non-monadic `Applicative` instances have `(<*>)` defined in other ways. But now our split hits trouble. We cannot have
{{{
class S x where
  f :: ...
  f =  ...g...
class S x => C x where
  g :: ...
}}}
because (technically) `g` is no longer in scope for the default `f` definition and (morally) because only the `S`s which are also `C` should have that default definition anyway: the default `f` definition rightly belongs in the declaration of `C`, but `f` is not a method of `C`.

'''Requirement 2''' Some subclasses should somehow be able to offer default definitions for things in some of their superclasses.

If only we could write something like
{{{
class S x where
  f :: ...
class (instance S x) => C x where
  g :: ...
  f =  ...g...
}}}
where the extra `instance` marking the superclass constraint makes `S` an '''intrinsic''' superclass of `C`, so that `f` can be treated as if it were a method of `C` for purposes of `C`'s instances and for default definition in the `C` class declaration.

If this machinery had been in place when `Applicative` was invented, we could just have given
{{{
class (instance Functor f) => Applicative f where
  return :: x -> f x
  (<*>)  :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  fmap = (<*>) . return
class (instance Applicative m) => Monad m where
  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  mf <*> ma = mf >>= \ f -> ma >>= \ a -> return (f a)
}}}
and, moreover, we could have chosen to give `Monad` its own specialized `fmap`
{{{
  fmap f ma = ma >>= \ a -> return (f a)
}}}

'''Requirement 3''' Subclasses declarations should somehow be able to override default definitions from their superclass declarations. Such overriding default definitions should be further overridable in sub-subclass declarations and in instance definitions.
