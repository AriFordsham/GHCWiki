= Resources for newcomers to GHC =

This page is intended to serve as the first stop for those people who say, "I want to contribute to GHC, but I don't know quite where to begin." Begin here. While the [wiki:Building building guide], [wiki:WorkingConventions working conventions], [wiki:Commentary commentary] and [wiki:Debugging debugging] pages (always linked from the left sidebar) have great information that can come in handy while you're working on your first, or first several patches, this page is intended to have the details you will need to get rolling.




== First steps ==

[wiki:Building/Preparation Prepare] your machine, [wiki:Building/GettingTheSources clone] the git repo, and [wiki:Building/Using build] GHC. For the short, short version, which may or may not work for your machine, you can try this:

{{{#!comment
-- Note: when this page got mentioned on reddit, git.haskell.org couldn't handle the load, so we now tell newcomers to clone from github, even though it requires one more initial step.
git clone --recursive git://git.haskell.org/ghc.git
}}}

{{{
#!sh
# needed only once, URL rewrite rule is persisted in ${HOME}/.gitconfig
git config --global url."git://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf git://github.com/ghc/packages/ 

# clone GHC's main Git repository (creates './ghc' folder in CWD)
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ghc/ghc
cd ghc/

# configure build
cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk

## edit mk/build.mk to remove the comment marker # on the line "BuildFlavour = devel2"

./boot
./configure
# NOTE: On Windows you need to download some binary distributables before being able to build
# This only has to be done once and can be done by adding a flag to the call to configure:
./configure --enable-tarballs-autodownload

# build GHC
make -j8 # parallelize to at most 8 parallel jobs; adapt to actual number of cpu cores
}}}

    If your machine has all the prerequisites, this might just work. Expect it all to take roughly an hour.

* While you are waiting for your build to finish, orient yourself to the general architecture of GHC. This [http://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html article] is written by two of the chief architects of GHC, Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton-Jones, is excellent and current (2012).

* After a successful build, you should have your brand new compiler in `./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`. (GHCi is launched with `./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2 --interactive`). Try it out.


== Fast rebuilding ==
There are 4 things to remember:
 1. Select `BuildFlavour = devel2` in your `mk/build.mk` file (copy `mk/build.mk.sample` to `mk/build.mk` first), to
    [Building/Using#HowtomakeGHCbuildquickly make GHC build more quickly].

 2. Don't run `make` directly in the ghc root directory. Instead, first
    change to the directory (`compiler`, `utils`, `ghc` or `libraries`) where you're making your changes.
    See [Building/Using#Buildingasinglesub-component Building a single sub-component].
 
 3. Set `stage=2` in your `mk/build.mk` file, to
    [wiki:Building/Using#Freezingstage1 freeze the stage 1 compiler].
    This makes sure that only the
    [wiki:Building/Architecture/Idiom/Stages stage-2] compiler will be
    rebuilt after this.

 4. Use `make fast` to
    [wiki:Building/Using#Skipdependencybuilding skip dependency building].

A good first sanity check is to twiddle some error message in the code, just to see that changed error message pop up when you compile a file. Write some Haskell code with an error in it, and look at the error message. Search through the code for that error message. Change the message, rebuild ghc (run `make fast` in the `ghc` directory), and recompile your file again with `./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2`. If you see the changed message, you're good to go.


== Finding a ticket ==

Below is a list of tickets that appear to be "low-hanging fruit" -- things that might be reasonable for a newcomer to GHC hacking. Of course, we can't ever be sure of how hard a task is before doing it, so apologies if one of these is too hard.

Bugs:
[[TicketQuery(status=infoneeded,status=new,keywords=~newcomer,owner=,type=bug)]]
Feature requests:
[[TicketQuery(status=infoneeded,status=new,keywords=~newcomer,owner=,type=feature request)]]
Tasks:

== Practical advice ==

* Read up on the steps you are expected to take for [wiki:WorkingConventions/FixingBugs contributing a patch to GHC].

== Less practical advice ==

* Don't get scared. GHC is a big codebase, but it makes sense when you stare at it long enough!

* Be forewarned that many pages on the GHC wiki are somewhat out-of-date. Always check the last modification date. Email if you're not sure.

* You may want to look at these "how it went for me" blog posts.
