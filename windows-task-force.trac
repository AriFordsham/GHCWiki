== The Tasks

The list of known problems tagged as Windows issues can be found [query:status=!closed&os=Windows&desc=1&order=id on Trac]. It would be particularly great if people with commit rights could review the patches in the waitlist.

== The Process

For the time being, let's use the general [http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/ ghc-devs@] mailing list for coordination. As always, before starting any major work it's a good idea to shoot an email to ghc-devs@ and to file a Trac issue (or add a comment on an existing issue) to claim it.
