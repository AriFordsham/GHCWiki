= Building GHC on Mac OS X 10.2, by Kirsten aged 26 1/52 =

 1. grab the HEAD off darcs, per Building/GettingTheSources (no problems here)
 1.  run autoreconf (this went ok, because I had just upgraded my autoconf in order to build darcs)
 1.  run ./configure
 1.  oops, I only have happy 1.13, it wants happy 1.15
 1.  go to the happy download page. what, no Mac OS X binary?
 1.  grab the happy sources
 1.  ./configure, make, make install. so far so good
 1.  ./configure GHC again
 1.  LOL, I need alex 2.0
 1.  why isn't this integrated into the GHC build process? also, googling for just "alex" is un-useful. so is googling for "alex lexer" and "alex lexer haskell"
 1.  LOL, *still* no Mac OS X binary.
 1.  ./configure; make in alex
 1.  have disgusting IM conversation with friend while waiting
 1.  alex: "you lose at life":
{{{
Creating a symbolic link from alex-2.0.1 to alex in /usr/local/bin failed: `/usr/local/bin/alex' already exists
Perhaps remove `/usr/local/bin/alex' manually?
make[2]: *** [install] Error 1
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 1
}}}
 1.  consider a career change
 1.  rm /usr/local/bin/alex
 1.  sudo rm /usr/local/bin/alex
 1.  sudo make me a sandwich
 1.  sudo make install
 1.  okay, I have alex. yippee.
 1.  ./configure in GHC again
 1.  seems to have worked. With trembling fingers (or maybe that's just the freezing Southern California weather), type "make".
 1. OH NOEZ:

 1.  Cry.
 1.  Hmm, how old is my gcc, anyway?

 1. Will upgrading my gcc break everything? Probably. Should I do it anyway? Probably.
 1. Actually, upgrading gcc sounds about as appealing as a quadruple root canal. Maybe I can use gcc2 (2.95.2) instead.
 1. Aaaaargh, of course I'm not that lucky:
{{{
checking for gcc... gcc2
checking for C compiler default output file name... 
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
}}}
 1.  Start downloading tarball for newer gcc from: [http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/August2003GCCUpdate/]. Also consider becoming religious so I can pray for it to be actually useful.
