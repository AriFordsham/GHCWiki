* Someday, download a full repo so that I can check that the patches I want to send can be applied to the HEAD. grrrrrrrr

== Demand analysis ==

 1. Get code ready to check in:
   1. cleanup
      * files to go through:
          * basicTypes/Id.lhs
          * basicTypes/IdInfo.lhs
          * basicTypes/NewDemand.lhs
          * compiler/coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs
          * compiler/coreSyn/PprCore.lhs
          * compiler/iface/BinIface.lhs  
          * compiler/iface/IfaceSyn.lhs
          * compiler/iface/LoadIface.lhs
          * compiler/simplCore/SimplEnv.lhs
          * compiler/simplCore/SimplUtils.lhs
          * compiler/simplCore/Simplify.lhs
          * compiler/stranal/DmdAnal.lhs
          * compiler/stranal/WorkWrap.lhs
          * compiler/stranal/WwLib.lhs
          * compiler/types/Coercion.lhs
          * compiler/types/Type.lhs
   1. better comments (i.e., examples for things that may not work right)
   1. testing

 1. Update Commentary 

 1. Experiments:
   1. comparison with old strictness analyzer
   1. see whether new optimizations are helping
   1. remove special cases for {{{build}}} and see what happens

 1. Paper

 1. Modify worker/wrapper split
   1. so as to exploit the new analysis information

 1. Think about the right way to handle this coercion stuff

 1. Formal semantics?
