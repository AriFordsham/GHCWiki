This list overviews the active branches in the main GHC repository.

= Active branches =

 * `dicts-strict` '''Strict Dictionaries'''.  Nick Frisby. Make most dictionary arguments strict. It's stowed in a branch until `cardinality` is merged. It should be easier to implement after `cardinality`'s refactoring.

 * `late-dmd` '''Late Demand Analysis'''. Nick Frisby. See #7782. It's stowed in a branch become of some nofib slowdowns I'm struggling to understand.

 * `late-lam-lift` '''Late Lambda Lift'''.  Nick Frisby. We lift some lambdas before !CorePrep. I'm still determining when to 'not' lift a lambda. My terse notes [wiki:LateLamLift here].

 * `ticky-for-all-lets` '''Ticky for all `let`s'''.  Nick Frisby. I think this patch is in mostly good shape, but I had to revert it because of a silly mistake. Need to double-check it. It adds ticky counters for lets, even those that don't end up as proper closures.

 * `type-nats` '''Solver for Type-Level Naturals'''. Iavor S. Diatchki.  An experimental solver for discharging constraints involving natural numbers.

 * `type-reasoning` on ''base'': ''' Experiments with type-level reasoning definitions''':  Richard Eisenberg / Gabor Greif. Changes to !TypeLits and related files to support type-level reasoning. Mostly superseded by conversations summarized at TypeLevelReasoning.

This is a list of inactive branches, including the date of their last commit.

 * `ghc-axioms` '''First attempt at branched type family instances'''. Richard Eisenberg / José Pedro Magalhães / Simon PJ. Last commit was Jan 3, 2012. This was an early attempt at implementing branched type family instances. Superseded by `overlapping-tyfams`.

 * `overlapping-tyfams` '''Proper implementation of branched type family instances'''.  Richard Eisenberg. Last commit was Dec 21, 2012. Merged into master on Dec 21, 2012, as commit 8366792eede3c8eb486ff15d8c8e62e9363f1959. See NewAxioms.
