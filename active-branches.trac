This list overviews the active branches in the main GHC repository.

= Active branches =

 * `late-lam-lift`: '''Late Lambda Lift'''.  Nick Frisby. We lift some lambdas before !CorePrep. I'm still determining when to 'not' lift a lambda. My terse notes [wiki:LateLamLift here].

 * `type-nats`: '''Solver for Type-Level Naturals'''. Iavor S. Diatchki.  An experimental solver for discharging constraints involving natural numbers.

 * `type-nats-simple`: Derived from `type-nats`, intended for eventually being merged into `master`, slated for 7.8.

 * `simd`: '''SIMD support'''. Geoffrey Mainland. This extends the simple SIMD support in GHC HEAD, and is slated for 7.8.

 * `th-new`: '''New Template Haskell'''. Geoffrey Mainland. This revamps Template Haskell, based on Simon PJ's proposal. See http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/Template%20Haskell%20Proposal

 * `ghc-lwc2`: '''Lightweight concurrency substrate support'''. KC Sivaramakrishnan. This implements an evolution of Peng Li's original concept of implementing a lot of the concurrency substrate in the RTS ''in Haskell''. The design is described in a paper, "Composable Scheduler Activations for Haskell", found here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/lw-conc/lwc-hs13.pdf.

 * `data-kind-syntax`: [GhcKinds/KindsWithoutData Syntax for ''kind-only'' definitions] (i.e. without the type definition when resorting to promotion). Ready for review and merge.

= Limbo branches =

These branches are not merged, but they are also not totally dead ended, and their status is currently uncertain.

 * `coloured-core`: '''Support for terminal color codes in `-ddump-simpl` output'''. Thomas Schilling.

 * `supercompiler`: '''Max's Supercompiler'''. Max Bolingbroke. This implements the ideas present in Max's PhD thesis, seen here: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-835.html

 * `local-gc`: '''Capability-local garbage collection'''. Simon Marlow & Simon PJ. As described in "Multicore Garbage Collection with Local Heaps": http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/local-gc.pdf

= Uncertain =

The actual status of these branches, including whether they have been merged and/or superseded, is not clear.

 * `cpr-sum-types`: '''CPR for sum types'''. Simon PJ.

 * `tc-arrows`: '''Rearrange the typechecking of arrows, especially arrow "forms"'''. Simon PJ & Ross Patterson.

 * `ghc-spj`: '''???'''. Simon PJ.

= Dead/merged branches =

This is a list of inactive branches which have been merged into the tree.

 * `ghc-parmake-gsoc`: '''Parallel --make'''. Patrick Palka, GSoC 2013. This extends `ghc --make` to be able to compile multiple modules in parallel.

 * `atomics`: '''Atomic memory operations'''. Ryan Newton. This expands on some work Simon Marlow started in 7.2.

 * `late-dmd`: '''Late Demand Analysis'''. Nick Frisby. See #7782, LateDmd

 * `dicts-strict`: '''Strict Dictionaries'''.  Nick Frisby. merged c73d372bfebb5acee45e196d4e8694b656c7fd82

 * `ticky-for-all-lets`: '''Ticky for all `let`s'''.  Nick Frisby. ~~I think this patch is in mostly good shape, but I had to revert it because of a silly mistake. Need to double-check it. It adds ticky counters for lets, even those that don't end up as proper closures.~~ … uh oh: looks like I merged this as 11a85cc7ea50d4b7c12ea2cc3c0ce39734dc4217 … I apologize for bad note-taking.

 * `ghc-axioms`: '''First attempt at branched type family instances'''. Richard Eisenberg / José Pedro Magalhães / Simon PJ. Last commit was Jan 3, 2012. This was an early attempt at implementing branched type family instances. Superseded by `overlapping-tyfams`.

 * `overlapping-tyfams`: '''Proper implementation of branched type family instances'''.  Richard Eisenberg. Last commit was Dec 21, 2012. Merged into master on Dec 21, 2012, as commit 8366792eede3c8eb486ff15d8c8e62e9363f1959. See NewAxioms.

 * `type-reasoning` on ''base'': ''' Experiments with type-level reasoning definitions'''.  Richard Eisenberg / Gabor Greif. Changes to !TypeLits and related files to support type-level reasoning. Merged into master on July 24th by Richard.

 * `at-defaults`: '''Associated-type defaults'''. Max Bolingbroke. Merged into the 7.4 release.

 * `cardinality`: '''Cardinality Analysis'''. Ilya Sergey. This will be part of the 7.8 release.

 * `encoding`: '''Better UTF8 encoding support'''. Max Bolingbroke. This was merged into 7.4

 * `type-holes-branch`: '''Support for Type Holes'''. Simon PJ, Sean Leather and Thijs Alkemade. This will be part of the 7.8 release.

 * `imp-param-class`: '''Turn Implicit Parameters into functional dependencies using TypeNats'''. Iavor Diatchki. Merged and will be part of 7.8(?)

 * `patch-5084`: '''Fix for #5084'''. Max Bolingbroke. SimonPJ fixed it differently for 7.4(?)

 * `known-key-serialization`: '''Iface serialization changes'''. Max Bolingbroke. Merged in 7.4(?)
