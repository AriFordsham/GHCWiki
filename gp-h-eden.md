# Glasgow Parallel Haskell (GpH) and Eden documentation


This page will describe the GpH and Eden parallel variants of GHC.  This is work in progress.


St Andrews has hosted the [HackPar](hack-par) parallel hackathon in December 2009.


Heriot-Watt will host a [HackSprint](hack-sprint) meeting 12-14th December 2010. 



Heriot-Watt will host the [ http://saints.sqpn.com/blessed-clement-of-dunblane/ Blessed Clement of Dunblane](http://saints.sqpn.com/blessed-clement-of-dunblane/ Blessed Clement of Dunblane) [HackDay](gp-h-eden/hack-day-mar13) on Tue March 19th, 2013.



A series of [Parallel Hacker Meetings](gp-h-eden/meetings) has been launched.

---


What follows is an entry page to describe technical documentation of the Eden/GpH implementation in parallel systems with distributed memory.


The different aspects are covered by separate pages reachable from here.

## Modifications to implement Eden (and parallel RTS instances in general)

- [Compiler Ways](gp-h-eden/compiler-ways) for parallelism
- [Startup and Shutdown](gp-h-eden/start-stop) of the parallel system
- [Packing and Unpacking Heap Structures](gp-h-eden/packing)
- [Primitive Operations for Coordination Control](gp-h-eden/primitives)
- [Placeholders, Garbage Collection, other Aspects](gp-h-eden/placeholders-and-gc)


Future work

- event logging for parallel Haskell
- GUM variant of packing code, using global addressing

## Communication


 
A mailing list for parallel Haskell implementors has been set up at HWU: 
[ hackpar](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo.cgi/hackpar)

## Tasks


This list of tasks is based on the discussion during the parallel hackathon, Dec 2009.
Each task has a maintainer associated with it, who looks after the software.

- GpH/Eden Code maintenance: (HWL to oversee)

  - Scheduling: Per-PE scheduling and load distribution policies (VJ)
  - Packing/Serialisation: Turning a graph into a write-/send-able format (JB)
  - Distributed Shared Memory: Abstraction layer over distribution of heap (HWL)
  - Communication: Sending and receiving work and data (MKA)
  - Monitoring/Tracing: MD/TH
- Visualisation Tools: Visualising parallel execution (MD/TH)
- Parallel NoFib Suite: Parallel benchmark programs (HE)
- Testsuite: Programs testing the parallel RTS
- Packaging and building: ???
- Darcs repo maintenance: Main repos in Marburg (JB)
- GpH/Eden tracs ticketing: Bug reports (HWL)
