# Wiki Page Names


Wiki page names commonly use the [CamelCase](camel-case) convention. Within wiki text, any word in [CamelCase](camel-case) automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that name.

[CamelCase](camel-case) page names must follow these rules:

1. The name must consist of **alphabetic characters only**. No digits, spaces, punctuation, or underscores are allowed.
1. A name must have at least two capital letters.
1. The first character must be capitalized.
1. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
1. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted in page names (possibly representing a hierarchy).


If you want to create a wiki page that doesn't follow [CamelCase](camel-case) rules you can use the following syntax:

```wiki
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],
   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"]
   and with a label: [wiki:"Space Matters" all about white space]
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s
 * even better, the new [[WikiCreole link style]]
   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]
```


This will be rendered as:

- Wiki_page?, ISO9000?,
  and with a label: ISO 9000 standard?
- Space Matters?*(that page name embeds space characters)*
  and with a label: all about white space?
- or simply: WikiPageName?s *(old MoinMoin's internal free links style)*
- even better, the new WikiCreole link style?
  and with a label: WikiCreole style links?*(since 0.12, also now adopted by MoinMoin)*


Starting with Trac 0.11, it's also possible to link to a specific *version* of a Wiki page, as you would do for a specific version of a file, for example: [WikiStart\@1](wiki-start?version=1).


You can also prevent a [CamelCase](camel-case) name to be interpreted as a [TracLinks](trac-links), by quoting it. See [TracLinks\#EscapingLinks](trac-links#escaping-links).


As visible in the example above, one can also append an anchor to a Wiki page name, in order to link to a specific section within that page. The anchor can easily be seen by hovering the mouse over a section heading, then clicking on the Â¶ sign that appears at its end. The anchor is usually generated automatically, but it's also possible to specify it explicitly: see [WikiFormatting\#using-explicit-id-in-heading](wiki-formatting#).
