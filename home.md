This is GHC's GitLab instance. GitLab has replaced Trac and Phabricator as the center of GHC's development community.

# Migration from Trac

## Logging in

If you had a Trac account then you likely already have a GitLab account as a result of the Trac import. This account will have a username of the form `trac-$TRAC_USERNAME`. You can reset your password with the [Forgot your password?](https://gitlab.haskell.org/users/password/new) dialogue. Once you have gained access to this account you may change your username to remove the `trac-` prefix

If you do not have a Trac account (or would prefer to start from scratch with a new account) you can [log in](https://gitlab.haskell.org/users/auth/github) using your GitHub account or [create](https://gitlab.haskell.org/users/sign_in) a new GitLab account.

As a last resort, please contact @bgamari with your email address. 

## Tickets

Most of the tickets here were carried over from GHC's previous Trac installation. See the [wiki](tickets-from-trac) for details about this migration.
