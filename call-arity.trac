= Call Arity notes =

This wiki page is about the Call Arity analysis and transformation, which eta-expands definitions if we know that it is always being called with a certain number of arguments. This looks a the ''uses'' of a function, which is different from the the code in  CoreArity, which looks at the ''definition'' of a function.

This pages does '''not''' document Call Arity as implemented; that documentation should be found and maintained with the code, at source:compiler/simplCore/CallArity.hs.

This page used to discuss possible changes to the analysis, but these are implemented now ([cb8a63c]), so I removed the obsolete notes from here.

More information on the analysis can be found in the [http://www.joachim-breitner.de/publications/CallArity-TFP.pdf TFP 2013 paper]. A proof of safety can be found in a paper [http://www.joachim-breitner.de/publications/CallArity-Haskell15.pdf presented at Haskellâ€™15] and in the [http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Call_Arity.shtml Isabelle formalization of Call Arity.]
