= Project suggestions for the 2006 GHC hackathon =

Add your suggestions for the hackathon below...

 * Hack to allow RTS to integrate with an external event loop (eg to give us ideal threading when using Gtk+)
 * Add a {{{ghc --clean}}} that just executes {{{find -name '*.o' -o -name '*.hi' -exec rm {} \;}}}, perhaps in a more portable fashion
