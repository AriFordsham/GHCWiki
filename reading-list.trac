= The GHC reading list =

Suppose you want to start contributing to GHC: what should you read by way of background?  Here is an annotated list.  Please add to it as you come across useful material.

You can ask questions on `ghc-devs@haskell.org`. People are friendly.  See also [wiki:WorkingConventions working on GHC] and [wiki:TeamGHC The GHC Team].

== General background ==

 * The [wiki:Commentary GHC Commentary] is a Wiki that describes GHC's implementation.  It is a Wiki.  That means that you can, and should, fix errors and write new chapters.

 * [http://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html The Glasgow Haskell Compiler], in [http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html The Architecture of Open Source Applications], Volume II, ed Brown & Wilson. This paper gives an up to date (2012) technical overview of GHC.

 * Simon PJ's [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj home page] and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/papers.html publications page] have lots of relevant papers.  Some key ones appear below but not all.

 * Simon PJ's books:
   * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/index.htm The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages]
   * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/pj-lester-book/ Implementing Functional Languages: a tutorial]
   give useful general background. They are not GHC-specific at all, but they have lots of information about functional-language compilers.

   * ''Giving Haskell a promotion'', Brent Yorgey, Stepanie Weirich, Julien Cretin, Simon Peyton Jones, and Dimitrios Vytiniotis (TLDI 2012).  How to (a) add kind polymorphism and (b) promote data types to become data kinds.
   * ''System F with Type Equality Coercions'', Martin Sulzmann, Manuel Chakravarty, and Simon Peyton Jones (TLDI 2007).  The first paper about System FC.

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/unboxed-values.ps.Z Unboxed values as first class citizens], SL Peyton Jones and J Launchbury, Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA'91), Boston, LNCS 523, Springer Verlag, Sept 1991, pp636-666.
