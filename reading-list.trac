= The GHC reading list =

Suppose you want to start contributing to GHC: what should you read by way of background?  Here is an annotated list.  Please add to it as you come across useful material.

You can ask questions on `ghc-devs@haskell.org`. People are friendly.  See also [wiki:WorkingConventions working on GHC] and [wiki:Contributors GHC contributors].

== General background ==

 * The [wiki:Commentary GHC Commentary] is a Wiki that describes GHC's implementation.  It is a Wiki.  That means that you can, and should, fix errors and write new chapters.

 * [http://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html The Glasgow Haskell Compiler], in [http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html The Architecture of Open Source Applications], Volume II, ed Brown & Wilson. This paper gives an up to date (2012) technical overview of GHC.

 * Simon PJ's [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj home page] and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/papers.html publications page] have lots of relevant papers.  Some key ones appear below but not all.

 * Simon PJ's books:
   * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/index.htm The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages]
   * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/pj-lester-book/ Implementing Functional Languages: a tutorial]
   give useful general background. They are not GHC-specific at all, but they have lots of information about functional-language compilers.

== Types and type inference ==

 * [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simonpj/Talk:OutsideIn Modular type inference with local assumptions], Simon Peyton Jones, Dimitrios Vytiniotis, Tom Schrijvers, Martin Suzmann, Journal of Functional Programming, 2011.  This epic 83-page JFP paper brings together, in a single uniform framework, a series of our earlier papers on type inference for type systems involving local constraints, including GADTs and indexed type families.  

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ext-f/ Papers about type equalities in GHC's intermediate language]
   * ''Equality proofs and deferred type errors'', Simon Peyton Jones, Dimitrios Vytiniotis and Pedro Magalhaes (ICFP 2012).  An exploration of what happens when you take equality proofs seriously in a compiler.
   * ''Giving Haskell a promotion'', Brent Yorgey, Stepanie Weirich, Julien Cretin, Simon Peyton Jones, and Dimitrios Vytiniotis (TLDI 2012).  How to (a) add kind polymorphism and (b) promote data types to become data kinds.
   * ''System F with Type Equality Coercions'', Martin Sulzmann, Manuel Chakravarty, and Simon Peyton Jones (TLDI 2007).  The first paper about System FC.

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/unboxed-values.ps.Z Unboxed values as first class citizens], SL Peyton Jones and J Launchbury, Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA'91), Boston, LNCS 523, Springer Verlag, Sept 1991, pp636-666. How unboxed data types work in GHC.

Please add: System FC, GADTs, kind polymorphism etc

== Optimisations ==

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/comp-by-trans-scp.ps.gz A transformation-based optimiser for Haskell], SL Peyton Jones and A Santos, Science of Computer Programming 32(1-3), pp3-47, September 1998.  Gives an overview of many of the transformations GHC does on Core.  Andre's [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/santos-thesis.ps.gz PhD thesis] gives more details.

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/inlining/index.htm Secrets of the GHC inliner], Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow, Journal of Functional Programming 12(4), July 2002, pp393-434.  Describes how the Simplifier does inlining.

 *  [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/deforestation-short-cut.ps.Z A short cut to deforestation], A Gill, SL Peyton Jones, J Launchbury, Proc Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA'93), Copenhagen, June 1993, pp223-232.  The famous foldr/build rule.  Andy's [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/andy-thesis.ps.gz PhD thesis] has more.  

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/rules.htm Playing by the rules: rewriting as a practical optimisation technique in GHC], Simon Peyton Jones, Andrew Tolmach and Tony Hoare, Haskell Workshop 2001.  Describes how RULES work, which are heavily used in GHC.

== Back end issues ==

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/eval-apply/index.htm How to make a fast curry: push/enter vs eval/apply], Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones, International Conference on Functional Programming, Snowbird, Sept 2004, pp4-15.

 * [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/spineless-tagless-gmachine.ps.gz Implementing lazy functional languages on stock hardware: the Spineless Tagless G-machine], SL Peyton Jones, Journal of Functional Programming 2(2), Apr 1992, pp127-202.  The original STG paper but still highly relevant.
