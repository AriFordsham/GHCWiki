= The GHC reading list =

Suppose you want to start contributing to GHC: what should you read by way of background?  Here is an annotated list.  Please add to it as you come across useful material.

You can ask questions on `ghc-devs@haskell.org`. People are friendly.  See also [wiki:WorkingConventions working on GHC] and [wiki:TeamGHC The GHC Team].

== General background ==

 * The [wiki:Commentary GHC Commentary] is a Wiki that describes GHC's implementation.  It is a Wiki.  That means that you can, and should, fix errors and write new chapters.

 * [http://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html The Glasgow Haskell Compiler], in [http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html The Architecture of Open Source Applications], Volume II, ed Brown & Wilson. This paper gives an up to date (2012) technical overview of GHC.

 * Simon PJ's [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj home page] and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/papers.html publications page] have lots of relevant papers.  Some key ones appear below but not all.

 * Simon PJ's books:
   * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/index.htm The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages]
   * [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/pj-lester-book/ Implementing Functional Languages: a tutorial]
