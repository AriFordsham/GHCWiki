= The VECTORISE pragma =

The vectoriser needs to know about all types and functions whose vectorised variants are directly implemented by the DPH library (instead of generated by the vectoriser), and it needs to know what the vectorised versions are.  That is the purpose of the `VECTORISE` pragma (which comes in in number of flavours).
