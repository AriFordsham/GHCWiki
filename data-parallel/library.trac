= The DPH packages =

This page describes the packages (aka libraries) that form part of DPH, enumerates all the wyas in which they differ from "normal" GHC packages, and says what stuff lives where.

== What packages there are ==

DPH comes with the following blobs of source code:

  * `dph/dph-prim-seq` implements the DPH Primitive Interface for sequential machines.  Compiling it yields package `dph-prim-seq`.  It depends on the packages `vector` and `primitive`.

  * `dph/dph-prim-par` implements the DPH Primitive Interface for parallel machines.  Compiling it yields package `dph-prim-seq`.

  * `dph/dph-base` implements the DPH User Interface, by importing the DPH Primitive Interface. The same source code can be compiled in two ways: 
     * Importing `dph-prim-seq`, generating package `dph-base-seq`
     * Importing `dph-prim-seq`, generating package `dph-base-seq`

'''SLPJ: what is dph-common?'''

The DPH libraries (in particular `dph-base`) use Template Haskell, so they can only be compiled with a stage2 compiler.

== How the DPH packages are coupled to GHC ==

GHC knows about DPH as follows.

  * The flags `-fdph-seq` and `-fdph-par` add `-package dph-seq` and `-package-dph-par`, respectively, so that the user can `import Data.Array.Parallel` and friends.  And so that the right package gets linked in the link step.

  * The flag `-fvectorise` runs a special pass called the '''vectoriser'''. 
    * The vectoriser generates code that mentions (by Original Name) various functions defined in `dph-prim-seq` or `dph-prim-par` (depending on the compiler flag used).  So if you change where a function is defined in `dph-prim-*`, or the name of the function, you have to make a corresponding change in GHC.
    * The vectoriser knows quite a lot about the internal working of the library. For instance, it knows about the array representation.
    * Parts of the library are vectorised and since these are low-level parts, they rely on being vectorised in particular ways. This means that a particular version of the library will only work correctly with a particular version of the vectoriser and vice versa.  '''SLPJ: can you be more precise here?  Which packages are vectorised?  What do you meean by "particular ways"?'''


'''SLPJ: is it correct that GHC only generates Names in dph-prim?  If not, could it be made true?'''
