== Source repositories for Data Parallel Haskell ==

The main repository for the library, ''package ndp'', is at

  http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/ndp/

This library package slots into GHC's build tree as usual.

Development on the vectorisation transformation currently happens on a branch of the HEAD, available from

  http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc-ndp/

The tag "`NDP vectorisation branch`" indicates the beginning of that branch.
