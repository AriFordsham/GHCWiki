## Closure conversion as part of vectorisation

**TODO** describe the treatment of higher-order functions and closure conversion here. The relevant paper is [ http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/\~chak/papers/LCK06.html](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/LCK06.html). The approach is described in more detail in [ http://opus.kobv.de/tuberlin/volltexte/2006/1286/](http://opus.kobv.de/tuberlin/volltexte/2006/1286/).
