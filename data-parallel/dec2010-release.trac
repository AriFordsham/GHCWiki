
== Plan for the December 2010 Release (moved to mid 2011) ==

=== To be released components === 

 * GHC ~~7.0.2~~ 7.2
 * DPH packages
 * Repa packages
(New release of vector is also planned.)

=== Before the release we must achieve the following ===

Documentation:
 * Haddock documentation of Data.Array.Parallel '''[MANUEL]'''
 * Replace `-XPArr` by `-XParallelArrays` in the Users Guide, also add `-fvectorise`
 * !HowTo and examples on !HaWiki [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell] [DONE]

API adaptation: APIs of vector, Repa, and Accelerate should be unified as far as possible
 * Repa's current 'replicate' should be renamed and a new 'replicate' that turns a scalar into an array should be introduced [???]
 * Check similarity of singleton/unit between all three libraries [???]

Changes:
 * -fdph-par should be the default (and sensible error message if the dph package is not available) (still needs to be passed explicitly) [DONE]
 * -Odph should be equivalent to '-O2 -fsimplifier-phases=3 -fsimplifier-iterations=20' [DONE]
 * Move GHC.PArr into  the DPH libs.  (Needed for Haddock.) '''[MANUEL]'''
 * Find out if we still need the `NoSpecConstr` annotation and remove it if not '''[ROMAN]'''

Bug fixes:
 * Vectoriser needs to be adapted to Simon's recursive superclasses patch; partially done, but recursive data types don't work yet [DONE]
 * The combination '-fvectorise -O0' should work '''[ROMAN]'''
 * Trying to vectorise the `DotP` example from the tutorial on the Haskell Wiki, `-fdph-seq` fails with (`-fdph-par` works fine)
{{{
*** Vectorisation error ***
    Tycon not vectorised:  Data.Array.Parallel.Lifted.PArray.PArray
}}}
 * LLVM back end only partially working with DPH (held up due to LLVM backend problems in the HEAD #4838); only affects !BarnesHut [BEN]
 * Repa edge-detection is deadlocking with more than 2 threads [DONE]
 * Fix the BH seg fault in DPH. Roman has found the problem [DONE]


Performance goals:
 * rl wrote "Alas, I just noticed that with -fdph-par, some of the examples seem to trigger !LiberateCase a lot, resulting in absolutely ridiculous code blow-up."
  * rl fixed bounds checking related issues and needs to release a new vector (which needs to be pulled into the GHC vector repo) '''[ROMAN]'''
  * In addition, there is a problem with join points in the presence of errors (diverging computations) '''[ROMAN, SIMON]'''
 * Vector works fast, sequentially, compared to C, Haskell mutable-array version [FINE]
  * Benchmarks: !NoSlow, vector versions of Repa benchmarks
 * Repa works fast in parallel
  * MMult [OK, but about 20% slower than in 6.13; try with LLVM and w/o bounds checks] [BEN]
  * Laplace (new stencil implementation) [BEN]
  * Blur [OK]
  * !EdgeDetect [OK]
  * FFT [OK]
 * Statically-nested DPH programs should work fast, in parallel
  * !SumSquares [FINE]
  * Dot product [FINE]
  * Evens [OK (but more than 3 times slower than C; any improvement since #4830 was fixed?)]
    * rl reckons this is due to GHC compiling modulo of powers of two inefficiently; c.f., #3065 (in `packByTags`)
  * SMVM (blocked on optimisation of lifted indexing) [Done]
 * Dynamically-nested DPH programs without user-defined datatypes should run correctly and scale, but absolute performance may be lacking
  * Quicksort [BROKEN (SpecConstr loop when using `-dph-seq`) & SLOW] [SIMON & BEN]
  * Quickhull [OK]
 * Dynamically-nested DPH programs with user-defined datatypes should run correctly, but not necessarily fast
  * Words [BROKEN (SpecConstr loop again, when using `-dph-seq`; same as Quicksort)] [ROMAN & SIMON]
    * #4831
  * !BarnesHut. [BROKEN: ROMAN]

    Works well
  [OK]::
   Fine for the release, but could be better

Tags in '''bold''' require attention before the release.
