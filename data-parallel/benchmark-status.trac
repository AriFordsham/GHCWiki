This page gives an overview of how well the benchmarks in the [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/ examples/] directory of package dph are currently working.

=== Overview over the benchmark programs ===

 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/sumsq/ SumSq]::
  Computes the sum of the squares from 1 to N using `Int`.  There are two variants of this program: (1) "primitives" is directly coded against the array primitives from package dph and (2) "vectorised" is a high-level DPH program transformed by GHC's vectoriser.  As a reference implementation, we have a sequential C program denoted by "ref C".
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/dotp/ DotP]::
  Computes the dot product of two vectors of `Double`s.  There are two variants of this program: (1) "primitives" is directly coded against the array primitives from package dph and (2) "vectorised" is a high-level DPH program transformed by GHC's vectoriser.  In addition to these two DPH variants of the dot product, we also have two non-DPH reference implementations: (a) "ref Haskell" is a Haskell program using imperative, unboxed arrays and and (b) "ref C" is a C implementation using pthreads.
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/smvm/ SMVM]::
  Multiplies a dense vector with a sparse matrix represented in the ''compressed sparse row format (CSR).''  There are three variants of this program: (1) "primitives" is directly coded against the array primitives from package dph and (2) "vectorised" is a high-level DPH program transformed by GHC's vectoriser.  As a reference implementation, we have a sequential C program denoted by "ref C".
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/primes/ Primes]::
  The Sieve of Eratosthenes using parallel writes into a sieve structure represented as an array of `Bool`s.  We currently don't have a proper parallel implementation of this benchmark, as we are missing a parallel version of default backpermute.  The problem is that we need to make the representation of parallel arrays of `Bool` dependent on whether the hardware supports atomic writes of bytes.  '''Investigate whether any of the architectures relevant for DPH actually do have trouble with atomic writes of bytes (aka `Word8`).'''
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/quickhull/ Quickhull]::
  Given a set of points (in a plane), compute the sequence of points that encloses all points in the set. There is only a vectorised version.  '''Currently doesn't work due to bugs in dph-par.  Also needs to get a wrapper using the new benchmark framework to generated test input and time execution.'''
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/qsort/ Quicksort]::
  FIXME
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/concomp/ ConComp]::
  Implementation of the Awerbuch-Shiloach and Hybrid algorithms for finding connected components in undirected graphs.  There is only a version directly coded against the array primitives.  '''Needs to be adapted to new benchmark framework.'''
 [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/barnesHut/ BarnesHut]::
  This benchmark implements the Barnes-Hut algorithm to solve the ''n''-body problem in two dimensions.  '''Currently won't compile with vectorisation due to excessive inlining of dictionaries.'''

All results are in milliseconds, and the triples report best/average/worst execution time (wall clock) of three runs.  The column marked "sequential" reports times when linked against `dph-seq` and the columns marked "P=n" report times when linked against `dph-par` and run in parallel using the specified number of parallel OS threads.

==== Comments regarding !SumSq ====

The versions compiled against `dph-par` are by factor of two slower than the ones linked against `dph-seq`.  

However, found a number of general problems when working on this example:
 * We need an extra -funfolding-use-threshold.  We don't really want users having to worry about that.
 * `mapP (\x -> x * x) xs` essentially turns into `zipWithU (*) xs xs`, which doesn't fuse with `enumFromTo` anymore.  We have a rewrite rule in the library to fix that, but that's not general enough.  We really would rather not vectorise the lambda abstraction at all.
 * `enumFromTo` doesn't fuse due to excessive dictionaries in the unfolding of `zipWithUP`.
 * Finally, to achieve the current result, we needed an analysis that avoids vectorising subcomputations that don't to be vectorised, and worse, that fusion has to turn back into their original form.  In this case, the lambda abstraction `\x -> x * x`.  This is currently implemented in a rather limited and ad-hoc way.  We should implement this on the basis of a more general analysis.

==== Comments regarding DotP ====

Performance is memory bound, and hence, the benchmark stops scaling once the memory bus saturated.  As a consequence, the wall-clock execution time of the Haskell programs and the C reference implementation are the same when all available parallelism is exploited.  The parallel DPH library delivers the same single core performance as the sequential one in this benchmark.

==== Comments regarding smvm ====

"SMVM, vectorised" needs a lot of tinkering in the form of special rules at the moment.  In particular, we need an overly general (and hence, in some case incorrect) rewrite rule to fuse repeat combinators and we need to artificially force the inlining of a specific function.  We need more expressive rewrite rules to specify the correct rule.  More generally, we need these more expressive rules to express important rewrites for the replicate combinator in its various forms; in particular, to optimise shape computations that enable other optimisations.

Moreover, "SMVM, primitives" & "SMVM, vectorised" exhibit a strange behaviour from 2 to 4 threads with the matrix of density 0.001.  This might be a scheduling problem.

All results are in milliseconds, and the triples report best/worst execution time (wall clock) of three runs.

==== Comments regarding !SumSq ====

The primitives scale nicely, but something is deeply wrong (lack of fusion, perhaps) with the vectorised version.

==== Comments regarding DotP ====

The benchmark scales nicely up to the maximum number of hardware threads.  Memory latency is largely covered by excess parallelism.  It is unclear why the Haskell reference implementation "ref Haskell" falls of at 32 and 64 threads.  See also [http://justtesting.org/post/83014052/this-is-the-performance-of-a-dot-product-of-two a comparison graph between LimitingFactor and greyarea].

==== Comments regarding smvm ====

As on !LimitingFactor, but it scales much more nicely and improves until using four threads per core.  This suggets that memory bandwidth is again a critical factor in this benchmark (this fits well with earlier observations on other architectures).  Despite fusion problem with `dph-par`, the parallel Haskell program, using all 8 cores, still ends up three times faster than the sequential C program.

On this machine, "SMVM primitives" also has a quirk from 2 to 4 threads.  This re-enforces the suspicion that this is a scheduling problem.
