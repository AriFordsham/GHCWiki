== Closure conversion as part of vectorisation ==

'''TODO:''' describe the treatment of higher-order functions and closure conversion here. The relevant paper is [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/LCK06.html]. The approach is described in more detail in [http://opus.kobv.de/tuberlin/volltexte/2006/1286/].

=== From the Skype discussion, 16 Mar 07 ===

For each function `f::ty`, create a closure-converted function `fc::ty'`, where `ty'` is the closure-converted verion of `ty`.
Optimisation: make `fc=f`, if the code for `fc` will be identical to that of `f`.  

For each data type `T`, create a closure-converted data type `Tc`, whose constructors use `Clo` instead of `->`.  Optimisation: if `Tc` is identical to `T`, don't create a new data type.
