= The {{{ExternalCore}}} type =

The {{{ExternalCore}}} data type is used by GHC to communicate code represented in the [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/CoreSynType Core] data type with the outside world. It comes with an external syntax, a parser, a pretty printer, and code to convert between Core and External Core. Unfortunately, External Core has not been widely used, and the code has bit-rotted. The recent changes in Core to use [wiki:Commentary/Compiler/FC System FC] have exacerbated the problem. This page documents the process of getting External Core and Core back in sync.

== Design decisions ==

TODO

== Tasks ==

  * Update the External Core data type to be compatible with the current Core data type.
  * Define an external text representation for External Core (which will probably be simply a minor modification of the old format)
  * Update {{{LexCore.hs}}}, {{{ParserCore.y}}}, and {{{ParserCoreUtils.hs}}} to support the new data type and external syntax.
  * Update {{{MkExternalCore.lhs}}} to support both the current Core and the new External Core.
  * Update {{{PprExternalCore.lhs}}} to print stuff that {{{LexCore}}} and {{{ParserCore}}} can understand.
  * Convert the current External Core documentation (in LaTeX) into a chapter (in XML) in the User's Guide.
