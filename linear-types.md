# Adding linear types to Haskell


This page contains information on the Linear Type Proposal.

## Discussion


The Linear Type Proposal has received a round of review [ on the ghc proposal repository](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/91).

## Source material


The motivations, technical details and examples on the proposal are described in the article [ Linear Haskell: practical linearity in a higher-order polymorphic language](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756) published at POPL 2018.

## Implementation


A prototype implementation can be found at [ https://github.com/tweag/ghc/tree/linear-types](https://github.com/tweag/ghc/tree/linear-types) .


A library to serve as a central library for linearly typed program can be found at [ https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/](https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/)
