The map example from ''Associated Types with Class'' in the new form:
{{{
data family Map k :: * -> *

data instance Map ()     v = MapUnit (Maybe v)
data instance Map (a, b) v = MapPair (Map a (Map b v))
}}}
We can define operations on indexed maps using a type class whose instances corresponds to the type indexes.  Note that a declaration, such as
{{{
data instance Map Int Char = Nonsense
}}}
is not acceptable, as it constraints the second argument of `Map`, which is not a type index, but a parametric argument.
