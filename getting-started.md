# Getting Started


How to get started with hacking on GHC:

- [Grab the latest sources](building/getting-the-sources)
- [Set up your build tree](building/hacking)
- Pick an easy bug report (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: bug, order: priority, group: difficulty) or task (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: task, order: priority, group: difficulty) to work on
- Useful information about GHC's architecture is in the [Commentary](commentary)
- Hack away... ask questions on [ the cvs-ghc mailing list](http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-ghc)
- Familiarise yourself with the GHC [WorkingConventions](working-conventions).
- [Submit patches back](working-conventions#submitting-patches), using `darcs send` is the recommended way.
