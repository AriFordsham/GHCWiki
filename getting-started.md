# Getting Started


This page tells you how to get started with hacking on GHC.

## Contributing to the Wiki

- [Register](/trac/ghc/register) an account, so that you can edit pages
- Look at the "Wiki" links in the green sidebar on the left of every page

## Getting GHC to build on your machine

- [The Building Guide](building) has all the information you need to set up your system for building GHC, and get a working development build.

## Deciding what to work on

- You may have a pet project of your own.  If you are wondering which bits of the compiler would be important for you, start by consulting the [Commentary](commentary). 
- Pick an easy bug report (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: bug, order: priority, group: difficulty) or task (Ticket query: status: new, status: assigned, status: reopened, type: task, order: priority, group: difficulty) to work on
- Help us with our [BugSweep](bug-sweep)
