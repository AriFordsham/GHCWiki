# Mailing lists and IRC


GHC developers hang out on the [ cvs-ghc mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-ghc).  This list also receives the following:

- checkins on the main ghc repository
- patches sent by `darcs send`
- nightly build reports


The traffic level varies quite a bit depending on how much activity there is.


Checkins for packages are reported on the [ cvs-libraries mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-libraries).  To get mail from all the `cvs-*` lists, subscribe to the [ cvs-all mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-all) (but don't post there, please).


GHC developers also hang out on `#ghc` channel on [ FreeNode](http://freenode.net/).  This is a good place to ask questions related to working on GHC itself; if you have more general questions then `#haskell` is probably more appropriate.
