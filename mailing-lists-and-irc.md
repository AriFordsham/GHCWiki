# Mailing lists and IRC


GHC developers hang out on the [ghc-devs mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-devs).


There is also [ghc-tickets](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-tickets), which receives a copy of traffic from the bug tracker, and [ ghc-commits](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-commits), which receives a copy of all commit messages.


The traffic levels vary quite a bit depending on how much activity there is.

## IRC


GHC developers also hang out on `#ghc` channel on [FreeNode](http://freenode.net/). This is a good place to ask questions related to working on GHC itself; if you have more general questions then `#haskell` is probably more appropriate.


Chatlogs can be found at [http://ircbrowse.net/browse/ghc](http://ircbrowse.net/browse/ghc).
