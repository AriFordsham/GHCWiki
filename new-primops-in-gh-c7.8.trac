= Primop changes in GHC 7.8

TODO: Austin, this page is yours to prepare. Please do mention `isTrue#` and encourage people to use it for converting `Int#` to `Bool` (if they need to do such a conversion that is). Deatils are [http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/PrimBool#Implementationdetails here] (second bullet) and in Note [Optimizing isTrue#] (in ghc-prim).

If you're interested in technical details behind this change, see [http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/PrimBool this page].
