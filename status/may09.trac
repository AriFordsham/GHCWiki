
 * 6.10.2 released. Bugfixes etc only.
 * 6.10.3: tiny release, "by the time you read this ..."
   * Moving to Haskeline
   * Fix ^C in ghci.

 * 6.12:
   * Release expected shortly after ICFP?
   * New build system: main bulk done, merged in head. Details still to be ironed out. Should be more parallel, and more correct (i.e. saying "make" should correctly rebuild things)

   * Donnie's profiler
   * unicode IO
   * shared libraries
   * DPH development continues
