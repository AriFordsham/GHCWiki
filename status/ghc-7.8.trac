= Release plans for GHC 7.8 =

== Tickets ==

''Note that anything not listed here is off Austin's radar.''

== Things to do ==

 * #8266
 * #8646
 * #7602 - OS X 10.8 seemed OK with Austin's patch, but OS X 10.9 needs investigation

== RC Checklist ==

Things tested:

 * Builds cleanly
 * `validate` runs OK
 * The compiler can bootstrap itself and `validate` from a binary distribution

||          ||Linux (i386)||Linux (x86_64)||OS X 10.7 (x86_64)||OS X 10.8 (x86_64)||OS X 10.9 (x86_64)||Windows i386||Windows x86_64||
||Builds clean||**OK**||**OK**||**OK**||**OK**![2]||**OK**||**OK**||**OK**||
||`validate`||In progress![1]||**OK**||**OK**||**OK**||**NOT OK**![3]![4]||**OK**![1]||**OK**![5]||
||bootstrap ||In progress||**OK**||**OK**||**OK**||In progress||**OK**||In progress![5]||

 * ![1] The testsuite performance numbers need to be updated for 32 bit platforms.
 * ![2] Austin has not directly tested 10.8 yet, but he speculates it is OK based on the 10.7 and preliminary 10.9 results.
 * ![3] Mavericks was tested using **Clang**, and there are some `make fast` failures (mostly minor driver related things, but not critical.)
 * ![4] Austin is hitting a `validation` error while building `xhtml`, which might be due to some interaction with the new Haddock. Otherwise, the compiler builds fine and the testsuite works.
 * ![5] Some of Herbert's latest patches to `integer-gmp` seem to have broke the 64bit build and need to be re-investigated, but once reverted the build goes smoothly.

== The Dynamic Story ==

The dynamic story is complex. Here's the breakdown:

||              ||Linux (i386)||Linux (x86_64)||FreeBSD||OS X 10.7 (x86_64)||OS X 10.8 (x86_64)||OS X 10.9 (x86_64)||Windows i386||Windows x86_64||
||Dynamic GHCi  ||**YES**||**YES**||**NO**![1]||**YES**||**YES**![2]||**YES**||**NO**||**NO**||
||`-dynamic-too`||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**NO**||**NO**||
||`-dynamic`    ||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**YES**||**NO**||**NO**||

 * ![1] Dynamic GHCi is disabled due to a bug in FreeBSD's rtld, but we're waiting for it to make it into a release.
 * ![2] Austin has not tested 10.8 yet, but he speculates it is OK based on the 10.7 and preliminary 10.9 results.
Where:

 * **Dynamic GHCi**: 
   * YES: `ghci` uses the system linker to link `.so` or `.dll` dynamic libraries, to avoid linker bugs. This is controlled by `DYNAMIC_GHC_PROGRAMS=YES`.
   * NO: `ghci` uses GHC's hand-written linker to link `.o` files.
 * **`-dynamic`**: makes GHC produce `.so`/`.dll` files rather than `.o` files.
 * **`-dynamic-too`**: strictly an optimization, `-dynamic-too` allows the compiler to build static and dynamic object files at once. This is convenient for Dynamic GHCi support.

== The Windows Conundrum ==

 * Windows is a bit difficult right now.
   * **Good news**: 64bit builds work using the fancy new MSYS2 environment with a few (~6) failures!
   * **Bad news**: 32bit builds work well using the **old** environment
     * Austin confirmed the latest HEAD worked in the old 32bit environment, but not the msys2 one: the `ghc-stage2.exe` segfaults, and Austin hasn't tracked down why.
     * Obvious theory: msys2 environment is incorrectly configured somewhere
     * On the upside, 32bit in the old environment seems quite stable (~3 test failures,) even if `make` is a bit nutty.
   * It seems `-dynamic` is busted, as well as `-dynamic-too`
   * Consequently, GHCi can't be dynamically linked.
   * We're punting all three of them for the RC.
     * This leaves GHC in the same place it was before essentially (but 64bit is in a difficult spot, see #7134)

(Related but not immediately critical: we have too many DLL symbols, and are very close to the limit (#5987). Linking also takes a long time (#8229))

== Other things ==

 * Austin Seipp needs to upload the primops compatibility package for 7.8. This is is easy: mostly a copy of `compiler/utils/ExtsCompat64.hs` into a Cabal package. See also [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Compatibility_Modules the compatibility module page].
