# GHC Status Report (April 2018)


2018 saw GHC's first release under its new accelerated release schedule. GHC 8.4.1 contained 

## Major changes in GHC 8.6

### Libraries, source language, and type system

-  The new `-XNumericUnderscores` extension allows underscores to be used in numeric literals, improving legibility of longer literals.

- The long-awaited `-XBlockArguments` extensions allows `do` and lambda expressions to be used directly as a function argument, eliminating the need for parentheses or an application operator.

- Possibly: The `-XDerivingVia` extension, a proposed relative of `-XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` which allows users to derive 

- The `Data.Functor.Contravariant` module from the `contravariant` package has been moved into `base`.

### Compiler

- The compiler's core simplifier now performs significantly more varieties of numeric constant folding.

- Incomplete pattern match warnings are now offered for guards in pattern bindings and `MultiWayIf` alternatives.

- A new syntax tree representation based on [ Trees That Grow](http://www.jucs.org/jucs_23_1/trees_that_grow/jucs_23_01_0042_0062_najd.pdf).
  This will make it easier for external users to add their own annotations to the
  `HsSyn` AST. In future this should allow Shayan Najd to harmonise the GHC
  and Template Haskell ASTs, and for the `ghc-exactprint` annotations to
  move into the GHC parsed AST (Shayan Najd and Alan Zimmerman).

- Further improvements in support for cross-compilation (Moritz Angerman)

- Replacement of the `make`-based build system with Hadrian. Hadrian,
  while being usable in GHC 8.4, should be able to replace `make` in
  nearly all uses. Moreover, it will have significantly better documentation
  and support relocatable installation trees, a feature unavailable in the
  current build system (Andrey Mokhov, Zhen Zhang, Moritz Angerman, Alp
  Mestanogullari)

- Many, many bug fixes.

### Runtime system

- Significantly improved Windows support with a new I/O manager, long file
  path compatibility and dynamic linking support (Tamar Christina).

## Looking forward: what's hot


GHC is lucky to have a large number of volunteer contributors.

- Matthías Páll Gissurarson has been adding support for significantly improved diagnostics messages for typed holes. His 

- Ryan Scott has been TODO

- Mark Karpov of Tweag I/O has been pushing forward GHC's continuous integration reboot. Using computational resources generously provided by Google X, GHC will be moving its continuous integration infrastructure to CircleCI and Appveyor.  This will allow us to more easily produce binary distributions

- Boldizsár Németh has been working on improving GHC's plugin story. GHC currently disables to its recompilation checking when compiling with plugin, dramatically increasing build times in common situations.

- Joachim Breitner has been continuing his work on improving GHC's treatment of *join points*. TODO

- Andreas Klebinger has been working on improving various facets of GHC's backend code generator. In the past few weeks alone he has contributed performance optimisations for GHC's C-- pass, improved common subexpression  elimination, and added infrastructure for taking advantage of branch likelihoods.

- Michal Terepeta has been performing a variety of refactoring in the backend, moving

- Tamar Christina has continued his work on making GHC run great on Windows. Recently he has been working to finish up a patchset enabling dynamic linking support on Windows. Tamar is also working on a rework of GHC's Windows IO manager implementation. The new implementation will take full advantage of Windows' asynchronous I/O interfaces and should solve dozens of long-standing tickets.

- In addition to contributing valuable code review and bug triaging, Sebastian Graf has contributed fixes to a variety of issues throughout the compiler, including fixes to demand analysis, 

- Recently Patrick Dougherty dusted off a long-dormant patch making the `ghc-heapview` package a first-class citizen. This package allows Haskell programs to introspect the heap

- Andrey Mokhov, Zhen Zhang, Moritz Angermann, Alp Mestanogullari, Tamar Christina, Patrick Dougherty and Tao He have all been working on the finishing the last mile of the switch to GHC's new Shake-based build system, Hadrian.

- One of the larger projects in the pipeline for 8.6 is Alan Zimmerman and Shayan Najd's refactoring of GHC to use the extensible Trees That Grow AST structure. 

- Simon Peyton Jones implemented so-called **[quantified constraints](quantified-constraints)**, which have been on the to-do list for over a decade, and were described in a 2017 Haskell Symposium paper [ Quantified class constraints](http://i.cs.hku.hk/~bruno//papers/hs2017.pdf).  A [ GHC proposal to adopt quantified constraints](https://github.com/Gertjan423/ghc-proposals/blob/quantified-constraints/proposals/0000-quantified-constraints.rst) was agreed, so they will appear in GHC 8.6.


Last year GHC
began accepting GitHub pull requests for small changes, particularly to
documentation. 


As always, if you are interested in contributing to any facet of GHC,
be it the runtime system, type-checker, documentation, simplifier, or anything in
between, please come speak to us either on IRC (`#ghc` on
`irc.freeenode.net`) or `ghc-devs@haskell.org`. Happy Haskelling!
