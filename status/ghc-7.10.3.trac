= GHC plans for 7.10.3 =

We have not yet decided when, or even whether, to release GHC 7.10.3.  We will do so if (but only if!) we have cases from users where
 
 * You are unable to use 7.10.2 because of some bug
 * There is no reasonable workaround, so you are truly stuck
 * We know how to fix it
 * The fix is not too disruptive; i.e. does not risk introducing a raft of new bugs

So please tell us if your problem falls in to this category, saying a bit about why it is important to you, and why you can't work around it.  It's worth attaching the details to the relevant ticket, plus send a heads-up email to ghc-devs to draw attention to it.
