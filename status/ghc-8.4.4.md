# GHC plans for 8.4.4


This page is our road-map for what will be in 8.4.4.  


If you believe your favorite thing belongs in this list, but isn't there, please yell.  If it's not in the road map, it probably won't get done.  Without a lot of support, many things in the road map won't get done either, so we need your help!

## Dates
