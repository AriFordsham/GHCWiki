= This page collects tickets that Simon PJ is interested in, so that he remembers them =

== Performance ==

=== Arity ===
 * #2822: arity expansion not happening right
 * #2823: another arity expansion bug (related to dictionaries)
 * #2440: bad code with type families; I believe this is also arity-related
 * #2762: Arity analysis
 * #2368: ASSERT fails in `CorePrep`.  Seems to be arity-related.
 * #2831: error expressions and arities

=== Inlining ===
 * #2396: default class method not inlined
 * #2354: NOINLINE pragma ignored
 * #2353: GHC inliner doesn't inline
 * #2420: Inlining of class methods infelicity (odd rather than bad)	
 * #2078: INLINing improvement; ask Christian.Maeder@dfki.de to see if it improves CASL
 * #1216: array indexing, inlining/arity bug	
 * #2840: top level unlifted string literals

== New code generator ==
 * #2253: NCG could do better. Look at this when John D’s ncg is working
 * #2838: trouble with `CmmInt` masking; watch out for this
 * #783: SRTs getting big	
 * #2289: cheap check at start of case alternatives	
 * #2731: avoiding unnecessary evaluation when unpacking constructors

=== Other performance ===
 * #2670: record selectors behaving badly wrt optimisation
 * #1434: Slow conversion Double to Int	
 * #2439: Strict dictionaries	
 * #2132: Optimise nested comparisons: if you know x>0 then you know x>=1 etc.  Maybe a special pass that knows about arithmetic?	
 * #149: float-out/CSE	
 * #2289, 2387: nested CPR analysis	
 * #2092: Possible quadratic-sized Eq instances. Does it really go quadratic, or does the join-point inlining machinery prevent it?  Still to check: delicacy wrt case-of-case
 * #2255, #2643: Improve '''`SpecConstr`''' for free variables, and for join points.
 * #2374: SAT and `MutableByteArray`	Max?

=== Compiler performance ===
 * #2002: Very slow compilation.   (There is linear stack growth with depth of linear list literal, which we think is ok, but it still should not be so slow.)	Needs profiling
 * #1969: quadratic behaviour in the specialiser
 * #2346: desugaring let-bindings
 * Use wildcards for dead variables in interface files.

------------------------
== Outright bugs ==

 * #1148, 2267, 1074: “Unused import” warnings should be generated from `RdrNames`	
 * #2182: GHCi session retains instance after removing a module from scope	
 * #2152: Bogus inlining of foregn import.  Arises from seeing through a NOINLINE in `exprIsConApp_maybe`	
 * #1241: Lifting the Coverage Condition for functional dependencies isn’t the Right Thing	Manuel
 * #2256: Incomplete inference due to lack of quantification over implication constraints.  Also, see “BUG WARNING” in `TcSimplify` line 717 or thereabouts.  `fdPredsOfInsts` is returning preds that mention quantified variables, which is quite wrong	Manuel
 * #2239: Lack of improvement with type functions	Manuel
 * #1954: Incorrect “defined but not used” msg	

------------------------
== Types and type inference ==
 
 * #1897: '''Ambiguity: don't infer a type that can't be checked if the type is given as a signature''' (this one is important)
 * #2859: optimise coercion terms
 * #2641: revise what `-XExtendedDefaultRules` does
 * #1634: deep skolemisation

=== Impredicativity ===
 * #2846: polymorphism leaking into constraints
 * #2193: Bad error message with impredicative types
 * #1330: another bad error message (Church2)

=== Better error messages ===
 * #2648: Report out of date interface files robustly	
 * #2599: Better error message for non-rigid types	
 * #2588: Better error message about ‘forall’	
 * #2360: Better location info in occurs-check message.	
 * #1856: Better error message for mutually recursive modules	
 * #1928: Confusing type error message (Claus makes suggestions)	
 * #2534: Another confusing type error message	
 * #2442: Better error message heuristics for “not in scope”	Max B’s patch
 * #2340: Better TH error recovery.  Easy to do; change to signature of qRecover.
 * #2900: Improve decomposition of function types	

------------------------
== Features == 

 * #788	Class aliases	
 * #2806: Require bang patterns on unlifted let-bindings	
 * #2600: Bind type variables in RULES	
 * #1930: Infix type operators:  a+b.	
 * #960: Generate local info for ‘undefined’.  Implicit location parameters in general	
 * #1475: Allow TH to generate import declarations	
 * #2135: Warn when exporting a function whose type mentions a type constructor defined locally but not itself exported	
 * #2526: Add -fwarn-missing-export-signatures	
 * #2119: Explicitly importing deprecated symbols should generate deprecation warnings	
 * #2116: GHCi should load as much of the module as it can	
 * #2207: Load interfaces for GHC.* even without -O	
 * #1231: Better deprecations	

--------------------------
== Not sure what to do about these ==
 * #2284: the state-hack "optimisation" causes much re-computation
