= GHC plans for 7.10.1 =

GHC 7.10.1 RC1 has been released. We're moving into stabilization and bug-fixing now.

See milestone:7.10.1 and [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=infoneeded&status=merge&status=new&status=patch&group=status&milestone=7.10.1 Active tickets] for more.

Anything in 'patch' status will be merged for 7.10.1.

Special things of note:

  - Phab:D538 - Alan needs this in and Austin will get it done for RC2.

  - Austin will disable the `dll-split` check for 7.10.1 RC2 since we're not building dynamically on Windows.

  - For 7.10.1, we're going to try to distribute Windows binaries using `minghc`.
