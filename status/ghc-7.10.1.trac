= GHC plans for 7.10.1 =

GHC 7.10.1 RC1 has been released. We're moving into stabilization and bug-fixing now.

See milestone:7.10.1 and [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=infoneeded&status=merge&status=new&status=patch&group=status&milestone=7.10.1 Active tickets] for more.

Anything in 'patch' status will be merged for 7.10.1.

Special things of note:

  - RC2 is expected '''Friday the 23rd, January 2015'''.

  - Only tickets marked "highest", or in "patch" status will go into RC2. If you know of another serious bug that should hold up RC2, yell now.

  - Austin will disable the `dll-split` check for 7.10.1 RC2 since we're not building dynamically on Windows.

  - For 7.10.1, we're going to try to distribute Windows binaries using `minghc`.

  - Austin will overhaul `ghc-7.10` branch release notes.
