= GHC plans for 7.10.1 =

We've written up some tentative [https://haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2014-October/006518.html plans for the 7.10.1 release]. Here's a short recap:

 * We're planning to freeze sometime in mid November, most likely.
 * We'd like a 3-4 month stable freeze (from Nov-Feb)
 * We'd like a release in **Feb 2015**, which is our goal.
 * We haven't planned an RC yet, but hope one **might be out by Christmas**.
