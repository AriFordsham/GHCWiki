= Tickets that Richard E. is interested in =

== Type system ==

'''Easy'''

* #3699: Wildcards in type patterns
* #7494: Allow type synonyms in GADT return types
* #8109: As-patterns in type patterns
* #8634: Dysfunctional dependencies
* #9122: Check for bogus `unsafeCoerce`
* #9636: Should `F Bool` be well-formed, if `F` is an empty closed type family? (blocked by #9637)
* #9687: Need `Typeable (,,,,,,,,,,)` and friends
* #9840: Allow empty closed type families
* #10116: Warn on incomplete closed type families

'''Medium'''

* #3483: Notation for known-inaccessible code, like `()` in Agda
* #6018: Injective type families (Jan is working on)
* #7296: Incoherent instance lookup is allowed within an instance declaration (by design)
  * #9820: Another example of the same behavior
* #7495: Allowing list syntax for `HList`
* #8128: Derived instances sometimes have inaccessible code
* #8165: GND should make associated types, too (not very well specified)
* #8388: Have a consistent story around non-`*` types in a forall
* #9180: Compile-time `staticError` function; seems easy, but I don't know how to do this.
* #9260: Type-lits solver falls short (given to Iavor)
* #9427: Break cycles in recursive class/type definitions (the second half of the fix for #9200)
* #9547: Better inference for whether `() :: *` or `() :: Constraint`
* #9637: Type-level `Error` that aborts compilation
* #9649: Proper type-level strings
* #9667: Don't make tyvars untouchable when a GADT pattern-match isn't informative
* #9883: Heterogeneous `OverloadedLists`
* #10075: `Constraint` vs `*`

'''Hard'''

* #3927: Warnings are broken for GADTs (Dimitrios is working on)
  * #7669: Empty case warnings are broken
* #8828: Type pattern synonyms

'''Rocket Science'''

* #1965: Allow existentials in newtypes
* #2256: Quantify over implication constraints
* #4259: Allow recursive checks for compatibility in type families
* #7259: Eta expansion of products
* #7961: Implement "nokinds" (RAE is working on!)
  * #9017: Bad error message b/c of missing kind equality
* #8338: Incoherent instances without `-XIncoherentInstances`
  * #2356: Strangeness about GHC's lazy overlap check
* #9429: An alternative to `Any`. For example, we want `Typeable (forall x. x -> x)`.
* #9562: Type families + hs-boot files = `unsafeCoerce`

== Typechecker ==

* #7788: More intelligent behavior around loopy type families
  * #8550: Probably a dup of #7788
* #9450: Interleave checking against an hs-boot file while typechecking definitions
* #9554: `-XUndecidableInstances` causes runtime loop
* #9557: Deriving instances is slow

== Roles & such ==

'''More/better roles'''

* #8177: Roles for type families (RAE owns, but is ''not'' working on)
* #9112: GND with `Vector`/`MVector`
* #9118: No eta-reduction possible
* #9123: Need higher-kinded roles

'''Error messages'''

* #9518

'''Solver'''

== Front end ==

* #7169: Warn about incomplete record selectors
* #7668: Better locations in deferred type errors
* #9194: Remove the magic from parsing `~`. Some open design questions.
* #9376: Improve error messages for closed type families that get stuck on the dark corners
* #9378: Make unknown LANGUAGE pragmas warnings
* #9394: `:info` should show instances of data and type families.
* #9778: Allow warnings for unticked promoted things
* #9784: Report better error for `Foo.'Z`

'''Medium'''

* #7401: Derive `Eq` and friends for empty datatypes

'''Design needed'''

* #7870: Customized error messages

== Template Haskell ==

'''Easy'''

* #7808: Allow reification of a data instance name
* #9022: Fix semicolons in pretty-printer
* #9113: Warn about incomplete patterns in quotes. Fixed by #3927?
* #9699: Function to list all names in scope
* #10094: Partial type signatures in TH

''Unknown''

* #9160: Some panic with optimizations and `singletons`.
* #9693: Stale state left in failed compilation with GHCi and TH.
* #10019: Reification in GHCi
* #10047: Scoping weirdness around quasiquotation

'''Design needed'''

* #1475: Adding imports/exports
* #1831: `reify` never provides variable info
* #4222: Reifying abstract types
* #5467: Haddock in TH
* #8679: Include value and function signatures in their declarations
* #8761: Pattern synonyms

== Generic programming ==

* #8560: Generic representation for GADTs

== Documentation ==

* #8253: Bad example of Core
* #9247: Document `-XDatatypeContexts`
* #9248: Document `-X` extensions
* #9665: Add a "since" field to language extensions
* #9737: Document `ANN` in pragmas chapter

== Tasks ==

* Search for email with subject "Branched and unbranched" in my GHC folder -- about refactoring some `CoAxiom` stuff
* Simplification for axioms: they can be applied to types, not coercions. See email with subject "checkAxInstCo"
