= Tickets that Richard E. is interested in =

== Type system ==

'''Easy'''

* #7494: Allow type synonyms in GADT return types
* #8109, #9608: As-patterns in type patterns
* #8634: Dysfunctional dependencies
* #9122: Check for bogus `unsafeCoerce`

'''Medium'''

* #6018: Injective type families (Jan is working on)
* #7495: Allowing list syntax for `HList`
* #8128: Derived instances sometimes have inaccessible code
* #9180: Compile-time `staticError` function; seems easy, but I don't know how to do this.
* #9260: Type-lits solver falls short (given to Iavor)
* #9427: Break cycles in recursive class/type definitions (the second half of the fix for #9200)
* #9547: Better inference for whether `() :: *` or `() :: Constraint`
* #9569: Tuple constraints should probably be flattened

'''Hard'''

* #3927: Warnings are broken for GADTs (Dimitrios is working on)
  * #7669: Empty case warnings are broken
* #8828: Type pattern synonyms

'''Rocket Science'''

* #1965: Allow existentials in newtypes
* #4259: Allow recursive checks for compatibility in type families
* #7259: Eta expansion of products
* #7961: Implement "nokinds" (RAE is working on!)
  * #9017: Bad error message b/c of missing kind equality
* #9429: An alternative to `Any`. For example, we want `Typeable (forall x. x -> x)`.
* #9562: Type families + hs-boot files = `unsafeCoerce`

== Typechecker ==

* #9450: Interleave checking against an hs-boot file while typechecking definitions
* #9554: `-XUndecidableInstances` causes runtime loop
* #9557: Deriving instances is slow
* #9566: Core Lint error
* #9567: Core Lint error
* #9582: Type families don't work in instance signatures (Andreas Abel is on the case, but stalled)

== Roles & such ==

'''More/better roles'''

* #8177: Roles for type families (RAE owns, but is ''not'' working on)
* #9112: GND with `Vector`/`MVector`
* #9118: No eta-reduction possible
* #9123: Need higher-kinded roles

'''Error messages'''

* #8984
* #9444
* #9518

'''Solver'''

* #9117: Doesn't find eta expanded versions
* #9153: Context reduction stack overflow

== Front end ==

* #2526: Warn only about exported missing signatures
* #7169: Warn about incomplete record selectors
* #7668: Better locations in deferred type errors
* #9109: Better "untouchable" errors
* #9194: Remove the magic from parsing `~`. Some open design questions.
* #9376: Improve error messages for closed type families that get stuck on the dark corners
* #9378: Make unknown LANGUAGE pragmas warnings
* #9394: `:info` should show instances of data and type families.
* #9497: Report other errors before complaining about holes

'''Medium'''

* #7401: Derive `Eq` and friends for empty datatypes

'''Design needed'''

* #7870: Customized error messages

== Template Haskell ==

'''Easy'''

* #7808: Allow reification of a data instance name
* #9022: Fix semicolons in pretty-printer
* #9113: Warn about incomplete patterns in quotes. Fixed by #3927?

''Unknown''

* #9160: Some panic with optimizations and `singletons`.

'''Design needed'''

* #1475: Adding imports/exports
* #1831: `reify` never provides variable info
* #8679: Include value and function signatures in their declarations
* #8761: Pattern synonyms

== Documentation ==

* #8253: Bad example of Core
* #9247: Document `-XDatatypeContexts`
* #9248: Document `-X` extensions
