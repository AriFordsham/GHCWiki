'''Development currently ongoing'''.

See milestone:7.12.1 and [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=infoneeded&status=merge&status=new&status=patch&group=status&milestone=7.12.1 Active tickets] for more.

== Tentative release highlights

  - An [wiki:ImprovedLLVMBackend Improved LLVM Backend] that ships with every major Tier 1 platform.
  - Improved [wiki:DWARF DWARF based debugging support] from Peter Wortmann & Arash Rouhani, with e.g. LLVM support and Haskell backtraces from Haskell code.
  - Support for [wiki:ApplicativeDo Applicative Do], allowing GHC to desugar do-notation to `Applicative` where possible.
  - Support for [wiki:InjectiveTypeFamilies Injective Type Families], which allows you to specify type families which are injective, i.e. a one-to-one relationship.
  - Support for [wiki:ExplicitCallStack/ImplicitLocations implicit parameters providing callstacks/source locations], allowing you to have a light-weight means of getting a call-stack in a Haskell application.
  - Support for '''Type Signature Sections''', allowing you to write `(:: ty)` as a shorthand for `(\x -> x :: ty)`.
  - A huge improvement to pattern matching (including much better coverage of GADTs), based on the work of Simon PJ and Georgios Karachalias. For more details, see [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/pattern-matching/gadtpm.pdf their paper].
  - A (possible) overhaul of GHC's build system to use '''Shake''' instead of Make.
  - Support for reasoning about kind equalities, which gives promotion of GADTs to kinds, kind families, heterogeneous equality (kind-indexed GADTs), and `* :: *`. There is some discussion in [wiki:DependentHaskell/Phase1], but that's very low-level. I (Richard) have no good user-oriented write-up yet, but there shouldn't be much in the way of new syntax -- just fewer type errors.
