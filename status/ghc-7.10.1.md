# GHC plans for 7.10.1


GHC 7.10.1 RC1 has been released. We're moving into stabilization and bug-fixing now.


See [milestone:7.10.1](/trac/ghc/milestone/7.10.1) and [ Active tickets](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=infoneeded&status=merge&status=new&status=patch&group=status&milestone=7.10.1) for more.


Anything in 'patch' status will be merged for 7.10.1.


Special things of note:

- The **Final Release** will probably happen in (late) March 2015.

- We'll probably do an RC3 in ~~February~~March.

- We will fix `merge`, `patch`, and `highest` priority bugs (only) in the list below

- Austin will disable the `dll-split` check for 7.10.1 RC2 since we're not building dynamically on Windows.

- For 7.10.1, we're going to try to distribute Windows binaries using `minghc`.
