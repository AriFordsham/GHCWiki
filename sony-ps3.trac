Assuming a Yellow Dog Linux install on the Sony PS3, you can get working ghc binaries (in rpm form) for ppc from

To build from source, (assuming you have installed a ghc binary package already) you may find the default {{{./configure}}} detects the system as {{{powerpc64-unknown-linux}}}.  This blew up for me when compiling {{{StgCRun.c}}} with assembler {{{junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `@'}}} errors.  The fix is to pass an argument to configure to force a normal powerpc build {{{./configure --build=powerpc-unknown-linux}}}.

Build time was about 8 hours (with extralibs), including a couple of hours on the penultimate source file to be compiled.
