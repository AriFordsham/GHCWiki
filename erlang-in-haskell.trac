== Cloud Haskell ==

Cloud Haskell is a distributed computing framework for Haskell, implemented in Haskell. It's a tool for writing applications that coordinate their work on a cluster of commodity computers or virtual machines. This is useful for providing highly reliable, redundant, long-running services, as well as for building compute-intensive applications that can benefit from lots of hardware. It has two interfaces:

  * The ''process layer'' (aka ErlangInHaskell): an interface based on message-passing between distributed processes.
  * The ''task layer'' (aka SkywritingInHaskell): a fault-tolerant data-centric interface.

Here are some resources relevant to this project:

  * [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jee36/remote.pdf A paper on the process layer]
  * [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jee36/remote/ Haddock documentation]
  * [http://github.com/jepst/CloudHaskell The source repository]

This is currently being worked on by [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jee36/jee36.html me]. Feel free to drop me a line.
