== Releases ==

Here are our [WorkingConventions/Releases release] plans for

  * [wiki:Status/GHC-7.8.4 GHC 7.8.4]
  * [wiki:Status/GHC-7.10.1 GHC 7.10.1]

== Automated builds and performance testing ==

We have several automated ways of monitoring GHC.  Each has its own detailed description page.
 * [wiki:BuilderSummary The GHC builders] build GHC every night on multiple platforms.
 * [wiki:Travis] watches the repository for new commits (any branch) and validates them.
 * [http://ghcspeed-nomeata.rhcloud.com Our performance dashboard] (experimental) monitors changes in the performance of GHC itself, and of programs compiled by GHC, with a per-commit granularity.
 * [https://phabricator.haskell.org/harbormaster Harbormaster] is a part of Phabricator, which builds all GHC commits and incoming patches for testing. To find out more, see the wiki:Phabricator/Harbormaster page.
