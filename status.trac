== Automated builds and performance testing ==

We have several automated ways of monitoring GHC.  Each has its own detailed description page.
 * [wiki:BuilderSummary Buildbots] build GHC every night on multiple platforms.
 * [wiki:Travis] watches the repository for new commits (any branch) and validates them.
 * [â€‹http://ghcspeed-nomeata.rhcloud.com Our performance dashboard] (experimental) monitors changes in the performance of GHC itself, and of programs compiled by GHC, with a per-commit granularity.
