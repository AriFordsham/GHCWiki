= Backpack =

This is the launch page for Backpack, actively maintained by Edward (as of Aug 2017). 

Backpack is a system for retrofitting Haskell with an applicative, mix-in module system. It has been implemented in GHC 8.2 and cabal-install 2.0, but it is [https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2540 not supported by Stack].

The documentation for how to use Backpack is a bit scattered about at this point, but here are useful, up-to-date (as of 2017-04-02, prior to GHC 8.2's release) references:

* This pair of blog posts: Try Backpack, [http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/10/try-backpack-ghc-backpack/ ghc --backpack] and [http://blog.ezyang.com/2017/01/try-backpack-cabal-packages/ Cabal packages] have up-to-date tutorials for using the main features of Backpack, with and without Cabal.

* The [https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/separate_compilation.html#module-signatures GHC manual section on module signatures] gives the gory details about how Backpack's signature files (hsig) work. A more user-friendly version of this can be found on [https://wiki.haskell.org/Module_signature Haskell wiki "Module signature"]

* There is not yet a manual entry in Cabal for how Cabal works. This section is under development.

* Edward Z. Yang's [https://github.com/ezyang/thesis/releases thesis] contains detailed information about the specification and implementation of Backpack. We also have an older [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backpack-2016.pdf paper draft] which was submitted to ICFP'16. History nuts can also read the original [http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/ POPL paper] but note that Backpack has changed dramatically since then.

* Hackage does not yet support uploads of Backpack-using packages. [http://next.hackage.haskell.org:8080/ next.hackage] is a Hackage instances running a development branch of Hackage that can handle Backpack; for now, Backpack-enabled packages should be uploaded here.

You might find it useful to find some code using Backpack.  Here are the biggest examples worth looking at:

* [https://github.com/haskell-backpack/backpack-str backpack-str] defines a signature and implementations for strings. It is quite comprehensive, and the packages are available on next.hackage.

* [https://github.com/ekmett/coda coda] parametrizes over a few core data types including notions of "delta". It takes advantage of zero-cost abstraction, which lets it split into multiple data types, while still ensuring they are UNPACKed in the end.

* [https://github.com/danidiaz/streamy streamy] defines a signature and implementations for "streaming" libraries (e.g., conduit, pipes and streaming).

* [https://github.com/ocharles/haskell-opentracing haskell-opentracing] defines a signature for the OpenTracing standard, a middleware built on top of this signature, and (at the moment) a single backend to Jaeger.

* [https://github.com/int-index/slay/ slay] is a layouting engine parametrized over `Double` and `Int` coordinate types.

* [https://github.com/ezyang/reflex-backpack reflex-backpack] is a kind of crazy experiment at Backpack'ing Reflex.  Reflex uses a lot of advanced GHC features and it took some coaxing to get Backpack to handle it all, but handle it all it did!

Some more out-of-date documents:

* [https://github.com/ezyang/ghc-proposals/blob/backpack/proposals/0000-backpack.rst Backpack specification]. This was subsumed by my thesis but once Backpack stabilizes it will be worth distilling the thesis PDF back into a more web-friendly format.

== Known gotchas ==

**Can I use this with Stack?** No, Backpack requires support from the package manager, and Stack integration has not been implemented yet.

**Make sure cabal-version is recent enough.** ([https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4448 #4448]) If you set the `cabal-version` of your package too low, you may get this error:

{{{
Error:
    Mix-in refers to non-existent package 'pkg'
    (did you forget to add the package to build-depends?)
    In the stanza 'executable myexe'
    In the inplace package 'pkg'
}}}

This is because internal libraries are feature-gated by the `cabal-version` of your package. Setting it to `cabal-version: >= 2.0` is enough to resolve the problem.

**You can't instantiate a dependency with a locally defined module.** Consider the following package:

{{{
library
  other-modules: StrImpl
  build-depends: foo-indef
  mixins: foo-indef requires (Str as StrImpl)
}}}

This looks like it should work, but actually it will fail:

{{{
Error:
    Non-library component has unfilled requirements: StrImpl
    In the stanza 'library'
    In the inplace package 'mypkg-1.2'
}}}

The reason for this is Backpack does not (currently) support instantiating a package with a locally defined module: since the module can turn around and *import* the mixed in `foo-indef`, which would result in mutual recursion (not presently supported.)

To solve this problem, just create a new library to define the implementing module. This library can be in the same package using the convenience library mechanism:

{{{
library str-impl
  exposed-modules: StrImpl

library
  build-depends: str-impl, foo-indef
  mixins: foo-indef requires (Str as StrImpl)
}}}
