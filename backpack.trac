[http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/ Backpack] is a proposal for retrofitting Haskell with an applicative, mix-in module system. The theory of Backpack is developed in the paper and its accompanying technical appendix; we also have an in-depth implementation design at [[GhcFile(docs/backpack)]]. The purpose of this page is to track implementation progress. (Wondering what happened to the old text? Check the history; it will be integrated into the implementation design doc eventually).
