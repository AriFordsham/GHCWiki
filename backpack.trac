[http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/ Backpack] is a proposal for retrofitting Haskell with an applicative, mix-in module system. The theory of Backpack is developed in the paper and its accompanying technical appendix; we also have an [http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/backpack-impl.pdf in-depth implementation design document] (source: [[GhcFile(docs/backpack)]]). The purpose of this page is to track implementation progress. (Wondering what happened to the old text? Check the history; it will be integrated into the implementation design doc eventually).

== Implementing "A taste of Cabalized Backpack" ==

Many of the features described in [http://blog.ezyang.com/2014/08/a-taste-of-cabalized-backpack/ A taste of Cabalized Backpack] are not implemented yet. Here's the blow-by-blow:

* GHC signature support is in progress at [https://phabricator.haskell.org/D130 D130]
  * exposed-signatures in GhcPackage behaves the same as required-signatures (GHC needs to consider these modules exposed for the purpose of module lookup)
  * We don't support multiple backing implementations for a signature, as SPJ mentions in Phab. The good thing about this is if we implement this we will automatically get signature merging. One difficulty: making sure all of the definitions of the signature have been satisfied! Also need to adjust package key format.
* Cabal signature support is in progress at [https://github.com/ezyang/cabal/tree/ezyang-dev ezyang/cabal:ezyang-dev]
  * We don't support the "semicolon" syntax, which allows you to include a package multiple times (usually used to instantiate it differently.) Monoid plus should be replaced with semicolon operation.
  * If anyone wants it: hiding and bulk rename for thinning/renaming
  * Figure out if you can rename types, and if not, what to do
  * implements field is not implemented
  * reexported-modules may not work with signatures (untested)
  * Support type families in signatures
  * Carefully test our hole map algorithm to make sure we're actually canonicalizing things enough (we probably aren't...)
* Typechecking against signatures (the next frontier)
