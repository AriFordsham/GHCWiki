 [http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/ Backpack] is a proposal for retrofitting Haskell with an applicative, mix-in module system. It has been implemented in GHC 8.2.

The documentation for how to use Backpack is a bit scattered about at this point, but here are useful, up-to-date (as of 2017-04-02, prior to GHC 8.2's release) references:

* This pair of blog posts: Try Backpack, [http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/10/try-backpack-ghc-backpack/ ghc --backpack] and [http://blog.ezyang.com/2017/01/try-backpack-cabal-packages/ Cabal packages] have up-to-date tutorials for using the main features of Backpack, with and without Cabal.

* The [https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/separate_compilation.html#module-signatures GHC manual section on module signatures] gives the gory details about how Backpack's signature files (hsig) work. A more user-friendly version of this can be found on [https://wiki.haskell.org/Module_signature Haskell wiki "Module signature"]

* There is not yet a manual entry in Cabal for how Cabal works. This section is under development.

* Edward Z. Yang's [https://github.com/ezyang/thesis/releases thesis] contains detailed information about the specification and implementation of Backpack.

* Hackage does not yet support uploads of Backpack-using packages. [http://next.hackage.haskell.org:8080/ next.hackage] is a Hackage instances running a development branch of Hackage that can handle Backpack; for now, Backpack-enabled packages should be uploaded here.

Some more out-of-date documents:

* [https://github.com/ezyang/ghc-proposals/blob/backpack/proposals/0000-backpack.rst Backpack specification]. This was subsumed by my thesis but once Backpack stabilizes it will be worth distilling the thesis PDF back into a more web-friendly format.
