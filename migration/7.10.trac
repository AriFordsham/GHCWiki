== Library changes

=== `base-4.8.0.0`

The major changes include the implementation of the ''Functor/Applicative/Monad-Proposal'' as well as the ''Foldable/Traversable-Proposal''

TODO

=== `deepseq-1.4.0.0`

The default method implementation has been changed, so instances defined via

{{{#!hs
instance NFData Foo
}}}

will now result in the following compile error (unless a `Generic` instance happens to exist):

{{{
Foo.hs:5:10:
    No instance for (GHC.Generics.Generic Foo) arising from a use of ‘Control.DeepSeq.$gdmrnf’
    In the expression: Control.DeepSeq.$gdmrnf
    In an equation for ‘rnf’: rnf = Control.DeepSeq.$gdmrnf
    In the instance declaration for ‘NFData Foo’
}}}

The easiest way make code work again with `deepseq-1.4.0.0` which was relying on the pre-1.4 default method implementation of `rnf` is to explicitly define `rnf` like so

{{{#!hs
instance NFData Foo where rnf x = seq x ()
}}}

instead of relying on the default method implementation.
