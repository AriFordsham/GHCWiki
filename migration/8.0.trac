This guide summarises the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from GHC 7.10 to GHC 8.0

==== Normalise `Applicative`/`Monad` instance definitions 

`base-4.9.0.0` continues to generalise functions from `Monad` to `Applicative`. However, in order to avoid performance regressions due to sub-optimally defined `Applicative`/`Monad` instances, it's highly advised to follow the
[[Migration/7.10#GHCsaysNoinstanceforApplicative... | AMP+MRP refactoring guidelines ]] that were already provided in the [[Migration/7.10|GHC 7.10.x Migration Guide]].

A new warning that needs to be enabled via `-fwarn-noncanonical-monad-instances` is available to help detect code which may be at risk.
