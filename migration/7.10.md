# GHC 7.10.x Migration Guide

## Library changes

### `base-4.8.0.0`


The major changes include the implementation of the *Functor/Applicative/Monad-Proposal* as well as the *Foldable/Traversable-Proposal*

#### GHC says `No instance for (Applicative ...)`


If GHC complains that

```wiki
Foo.hs:7:10:
    No instance for (Applicative Foo) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
    In the instance declaration for ‘Monad Foo’
```


then the easiest way to fix this error is by defining an `Applicative` (and possibly a `Functor`) instance:

```
instanceFunctorFoowhere
    fmap  = liftM

instanceApplicativeFoowhere
    pure  = return
    (<*>)= ap  -- defined in Control.Monad
```


For more details see [ AMP Proposal: Future-proofing current code](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functor-Applicative-Monad_Proposal#Future-proofing_current_code).

#### GHC says `No instance for (Alternative ...)`


A side-effect of the AMP is that `Alternative` became a super-class of `MonadPlus`. The easy remedy:

```
instanceAlternativeFoowhere(<|>)= mplus
    empty = mzero
```

#### GHC says `No instance for (Foldable ...) arising from the use of elem/null`


Some functions in the Prelude were generalised to `Foldable`s in the implementation of the FTP. This can lead to type-inference problems for code making use of `-XOverloadedStrings`, in which code like e.g.

```
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}main::IO()main= print ('I'`elem`"team")
```


will let GHC spit out the intimidating complaint that

```wiki
Foo.hs:4:19:
    No instance for (Foldable t0) arising from a use of ‘elem’
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Foldable (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Foldable’
      instance Foldable Data.Proxy.Proxy -- Defined in ‘Data.Foldable’
      instance GHC.Arr.Ix i => Foldable (GHC.Arr.Array i) -- Defined in ‘Data.Foldable’
      ...plus three others
    In the first argument of ‘print’, namely ‘('I' `elem` "team")’
    In the expression: print ('I' `elem` "team")
    In an equation for ‘main’: main = print ('I' `elem` "team")

Foo.hs:4:26:
    No instance for (Data.String.IsString (t0 Char)) arising from the literal ‘"team"’
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there is a potential instance available: instance Data.String.IsString [Char] -- Defined in ‘Data.String’
    In the second argument of ‘elem’, namely ‘"team"’
    In the first argument of ‘print’, namely ‘('I' `elem` "team")’
    In the expression: print ('I' `elem` "team")
```


This can be fixed by helping GHC's type-inference to pin down `"team"` to `[Char]`, either by adding a `:: String` to the string literal, or (for short literals) by using list-syntax (i.e. `['t','e','a','m']`).

### `deepseq-1.4.0.0`


The default method implementation has been changed, so instances defined via

```
instanceNFDataFoo
```


will now result in the following compile error (unless a `Generic` instance happens to exist):

```wiki
Foo.hs:5:10:
    No instance for (GHC.Generics.Generic Foo) arising from a use of ‘Control.DeepSeq.$gdmrnf’
    In the expression: Control.DeepSeq.$gdmrnf
    In an equation for ‘rnf’: rnf = Control.DeepSeq.$gdmrnf
    In the instance declaration for ‘NFData Foo’
```


The easiest way make code work again with `deepseq-1.4.0.0` which was relying on the pre-1.4 default method implementation of `rnf` is to explicitly define `rnf` like so

```
instanceNFDataFoowhere rnf x = seq x ()
```


instead of relying on the default method implementation.
