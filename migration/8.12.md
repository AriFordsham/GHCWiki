# GHC 8.12.x Migration Guide


This guide summarises the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from GHC 8.10 to GHC 8.12. This guide complements the GHC 8.12.x release notes which should be consulted as well.

## Compiler changes

### Overloaded Quotation Brackets

The type of expression quotation brackets is now generalised from `Q Exp` to `Quote m => m Exp`. All other forms of quotation are similarly generalised. There are two main breaking changes as a result:

1. Top-level unannotated quotations now fail to typecheck due to the monomorphism restriction:
   ```
   x = [| 5 ||]
   ```
 
   Fix: Provide a type signature for `x` or enable `NoMonomorphismRestriction`.

2. Methods of the `Lift` typeclass are restricted from `Q` to only using methods from `Quote`. The definition of `Lift` is now:
   ```
   class Lift (t :: TYPE r) where
     lift :: Quote m => t -> m Exp  
     liftTyped :: Quote m => t -> m (TExp t)
   ```

   If you have manually defined instances for `Lift` then it might be necessary to rewrite some type signatures in terms of the more restricted `Quote` interface. In our testing so far we've not found any `Lift` instances relying on any special methods of `Q`. 

   Another solution is to use the `DeriveLift` extension rather than manually defining the instance. 
    



### More validity checking in quantified constraints 

GHC now performs more validity checks on quantified constraints, meaning that some code will require enabling language extensions that were not previously required. As one example, this code will compile on previous versions of GHC:

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE QuantifiedConstraints #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

data family F a

f :: (forall a. Show (F a)) => Int
f = 42
```

However, it will be rejected with GHC 8.12:

```
error:
    • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Show (F a)
      (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
    • In the quantified constraint ‘forall a. Show (F a)’
      In the type signature: f :: (forall a. Show (F a)) => Int
  |
7 | f :: (forall a. Show (F a)) => Int
  |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
