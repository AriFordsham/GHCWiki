# GHC 8.12.x Migration Guide


This guide summarises the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from GHC 8.10 to GHC 8.12. This guide complements the GHC 8.12.x release notes which should be consulted as well.

## Compiler changes

### Whitespace-sensitive `!`, `~`, and `@`

GHC 8.12 implements [Proposal 229](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0229-whitespace-bang-patterns.rst), which means that the `!`, `~`, and `@` characters are more sensitive to preceding and trailing whitespace than they were before. As a result, some things which used to parse one way will now parse differently (or throw a parse error). Here are some particular scenarios that you may encounter:

1. ```hs
   f ~ x = x
   ```
   
   * Before: function named `f` with a lazy (irrefutable) pattern on its argument `x`
   * After: After: infix function named `(~)`

   To restore the old behavior, remove the trailing whitespace after `~`, like so:

   ```hs
   f ~x = x
   ```

2. ```hs
   f @ x = y
   ```

   * Before: value binding that binds both `f` and `x` to `y` using an as-pattern
   * After: infix function named `(@)`

   To restore the old behavior, remove the trailing whitespace after `@`, like so:

   ```hs
   f @x = x
   ```

3. ```hs
   f ! x = x
   ```

   * Before: function named `f` with a bang pattern on its argument `x`
   * After: infix function named `(!)`

   To restore the old behavior, remove the trailing whitespace after `!`, like so:

   ```hs
   f !x = x
   ```

4. ```hs
   f = g @ True
   ```

   * Before: visible type application
   * After: application of the infix function `(@)` to `g` and `True`

   To restore the old behavior, remove the trailing whitespace after `@`, like so:

   ```hs
   f = g @True
   ```

5. ```hs
   f = ($x)
   ```

   * Before: operator section that applies the infix function `($)` to the argument `x`
   * After: Template Haskell splice that splices in `x :: Q Exp`

   To restore the old behavior, add a space between `$` and `x`, like so:

   ```hs
   f = ($ x)
   ```

6. ```hs
   f = (!x)
   ```

   * Before: operator section that applies the infix function `(!)` to the argument `x`
   * After: parse error:
     
     ```
     error:
         Bang pattern in expression context: !x
         Did you mean to add a space after the '!'?
     ```

   As the parse error suggests, the old behavior can be restored by instead writing:

   ```hs
   f = (! x)
   ```

7. ```hs
   data T = MkT ! Int
   ```

   * Before: data constructor `MkT` with a strict `Int` field
   * After: parse error:

     ```
     error: Not a data constructor: ‘!’
     ```

   To restore the old behavior, remove the trailing whitespace after `!`, like so:

   ```hs
   data T = MkT !Int
   ```

### Overloaded Quotation Brackets

GHC 8.12 implements [Proposal 246](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0246-overloaded-bracket.rst), which means that the type of expression quotation brackets is now generalised from `Q Exp` to `Quote m => m Exp`. All other forms of quotation are similarly generalised. There are two main breaking changes as a result:

1. Top-level unannotated quotations now fail to typecheck due to the monomorphism restriction:
   ```hs
   x = [| 5 ||]
   ```
 
   Fix: Provide a type signature for `x` or enable `NoMonomorphismRestriction`.

2. Methods of the `Lift` typeclass are restricted from `Q` to only using methods from `Quote`. The definition of `Lift` is now:
   ```hs
   class Lift (t :: TYPE r) where
     lift :: Quote m => t -> m Exp  
     liftTyped :: Quote m => t -> m (TExp t)
   ```

   If you have manually defined instances for `Lift` then it might be necessary to rewrite some type signatures in terms of the more restricted `Quote` interface. In our testing so far we've not found any `Lift` instances relying on any special methods of `Q`. 

   Another solution is to use the `DeriveLift` extension rather than manually defining the instance. 

### More validity checking in quantified constraints 

GHC now performs more validity checks on quantified constraints, meaning that some code will require enabling language extensions that were not previously required. As one example, this code will compile on previous versions of GHC:

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE QuantifiedConstraints #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

data family F a

f :: (forall a. Show (F a)) => Int
f = 42
```

However, it will be rejected with GHC 8.12:

```
error:
    • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Show (F a)
      (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
    • In the quantified constraint ‘forall a. Show (F a)’
      In the type signature: f :: (forall a. Show (F a)) => Int
  |
7 | f :: (forall a. Show (F a)) => Int
  |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

## Library changes

### `ghc-8.12.*`

The meaning of the `hs_fixds` field of `HsGroup` has changed slightly. It now only contains fixity signatures defined for top-level declarations and class methods defined _outside_ of the class itself. Previously, `hs_fixds` would also contain fixity signatures for class methods defined _inside_ the class, such as the fixity signature for `m` in the following example: ::

```hs
class C a where
  infixl 4 `m`
  m :: a -> a -> a
```

If you wish to attain the previous behavior of `hs_fixds`, use the new `hsGroupTopLevelFixitySigs` function, which collects all top-level fixity signatures, including those for class methods defined inside classes.
