# GHC 9.2.x Migration Guide


This guide summarises the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from GHC 9.0 to GHC 9.2. This guide complements the GHC 9.2.x release notes which should be consulted as well.

## Compiler changes

### Kind inference for data family instances is pickier

GHC's kind inference for data/newtype instance declarations is slightly more restrictive than before. The new rule is this: in data/newtype instance declararations (unlike ordinary data/newtype declarations) we do *not* look at the constructor declarations when inferring the kind of the instance header.  The principle is that *the instantiation of the data instance should be apparent from the header alone*.

A consequence of this change is that some programs that compiled on previous versions of GHC will no longer be accepted under 9.2. Here is such an example:

```hs
data family T :: k -> Type
data instance T a = MkT1 a
```

Previous versions of GHC would look at the `MkT1` constructor to infer that `a` has kind `Type` and accept the data instance. GHC 9.2, however, only looks of the header (`data instance T a`) and concludes that `a` has kind `k`. As a result, the `MkT1` constructor is ill kinded, so GHC will throw an `Expected a type, but ‘a’ has kind ‘k’` error.

The workaround is to simply make the kind of `a` explicit:

```hs
data family T :: k -> Type
data instance T (a :: Type) = MkT1 a
```

## Library changes

### `base-4.16.*`

The `Nat` kind is now a type synonym for `Natural` (from `Numeric.Natural`). As a consequence, one must enable `TypeSynonymInstances` in order to define instances for `Nat`.

### `ghc-prim-0.8.*`

TODO: Mention `Int{8,16,32}#`/`Word{8,16,32}#`-related changes
