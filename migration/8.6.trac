= GHC 8.6.x Migration Guide =

This guide summarises the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from GHC 8.4 to GHC 8.6. This guide complements the GHC 8.6.x release notes which should be consulted as well.

----------------------------------
== Compiler changes

=== TH-spliced code can emit pattern-match warnings ===

In previous versions of GHC, code that was spliced in from Template Haskell would have any pattern matchâ€“related warnings suppressed. However, this [https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/14843 has been changed] in GHC 8.6, so now warnings //will// be emitted from TH-spliced code. For instance, the following code:

{{{#!hs
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

$([d| sketchy :: Bool -> Int
      sketchy True = 42 |])
}}}

Would not emit any warnings when compiled with `-Wincomplete-patterns` on GHC 8.4 and earlier, but will emit a warning on GHC 8.6 due to `sketchy` not matching on `False`.
