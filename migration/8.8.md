# GHC 8.8.x Migration Guide


This guide summarises the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from GHC 8.6 to GHC 8.8. This guide complements the GHC 8.8.x release notes which should be consulted as well.

## Compiler changes

### Kind generalization changes for local definitions


Starting in GHC 8.8, we now generalize the kinds in the types of local definitions (e.g., `let`- or `where`-bound functions). As a result, there are a handful of programs which will no longer compile. Here is one such example:

```
typefamilyLetGo:: k

foo::Proxy(LetGo::Type)foo= undefined

sSconcat:: forall (x ::Type). x
sSconcat= undefined
   where sGo :: x ->ProxyLetGo
         sGo _= foo
```


This kind-checks on previous versions of GHC, since the return kind of `LetGo` (in `sGo`) is not generalized, so we have `sGo :: x -> Proxy (LetGo :: Type)` (which is necessary for the body of `sGo` to typecheck). However, this will *not* kind-check on GHC 8.8, since the return kind of `LetGo`*is* generalized, giving us `sGo :: x -> Proxy (LetGo :: k)` (which is too polymorphic for `foo`). Therefore, this code fails on GHC 8.8 with a `Couldn't match type ‘k’ with ‘*’` error.


To avoid this, one can use an explicit kind signature on `LetGo`, like so:

```
  sGo :: x ->Proxy(LetGo::Type)
  sGo _= foo
```
