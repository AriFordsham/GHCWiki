### `base-4.9.0.0`

#### Normalise `Applicative`/`Monad` instance definitions

`base-4.9.0.0` continues to generalise functions from `Monad` to `Applicative`. However, in order to avoid performance regressions due to sub-optimally defined `Applicative`/`Monad` instances, it's highly advised to follow the
[ AMP+MRP refactoring guidelines ](migration/7.10#) that were already provided in the [GHC 7.10.x Migration Guide](migration/7.10).


A new warning that needs to be enabled via `-fwarn-noncanonical-monad-instances` is available to help detect code which may be at risk.
