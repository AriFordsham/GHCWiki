= Defining kinds without an associated datatype = 

This ticket to track this request is #6024.

When using `-XDataKinds` GHC automatically promotes every datatype to a kind, and its constructors to
types. This forces us to declare a datatype for every kind. However, sometimes we are not interested
in the datatype at all, only on the kind. Consider the following data kind that defines a small
universe for generic programming:

{{{
data Universe star = Sum  Universe Universe
                   | Prod Universe Universe
                   | K star
}}}

This universe comes with an associated interpretation:

{{{
data Interpretation :: Universe * -> * where
  L    :: Interpretation a -> Interpretation (Sum a b)
  R    :: Interpretation b -> Interpretation (Sum a b)
  Prod :: Interpretation a -> Interpretation b -> Interpretation (Prod a b)
  K    :: a -> Interpretation (K a)
}}}

In this case, having to declare a datatype for `Universe` has two disadvantages:

  1. We cannot use kinds (such as `*`) while defining a datatype, so we are forced to make `Universe` a parametrised datatype, and later always instantiate this parameter to `*` (like in the kind of `Interpretation`).

  2. We lose constructor name space, because the datatype constructor names will be taken, even though we will never use them. So `Prod` and `K` cannot be used as constructors of `Interpretation` as above, because those are also constructors of `Universe`.

'''Solution''': let users define things like
{{{
data kind Universe = Sum  Universe Universe
                   | Prod Universe Universe
                   | K *
}}}
By using `data kind`, we tell GHC that we are only interested in the `Universe` kind, and not the datatype.
Consequently, `Sum`, `Prod`, and `K` will be types only, and not constructors.

Also,
{{{
data type D = C
}}}
defines a datatype `D` which is not promoted to a kind, and its constructor `C` is
not promoted to a type.

== Caveats ==


=== Star in Star ===
If, in the future, we make `* :: *`, we will no longer have separation of
types and kinds, so we won't be able to make such fine distinctions.


=== Recursive Groups ===


=== Kind and Type Namespaces ===
As kinds and types currently share a namespace, `data kind` and
`data type` declarations ```in the same module``` can still
conflict.  However, if they are in separate modules, this can be controlled by
use of the module system.


== Alternative Solutions ==

Add
{{{
data Star
}}}
in `GHC.Exts` such that the promotion of datatype `Star` is the kind `*`. As a
datatype, `Star` is just an empty datatype.

''Advantages'': very easy, backwards compatible

''Disadvantages'': somewhat verbose, doesn't fix (2)


== Alternative Notations ==

 * Use `data only` instead of `data type`.
 * Use `'data` instead of `data kind`, suggested by Gabor Greif.

In both cases, we felt that using `type` and `kind` as the modifiers to the `data` declaration better reflect what's being defined.
