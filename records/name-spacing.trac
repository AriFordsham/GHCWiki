See [wiki:Records] for the bigger picture. This is a proposal to solve the records name-spacing issue with simple name-spacing and simple type resolution.

This approach is an attempt to port the records solution in [http://code.google.com/p/frege/ Frege], a haskell-like language on the JVM. Please read Sections 3.2 (primary expressions) and 4.2.1 (Algebraic Data type Declaration - Constructors with labeled fields) of the [http://code.google.com/p/frege/downloads/detail?name=Language-411.pdf Frege user manual]
Many thanks to the Frege author, Ingo Wechsung for explaining his implementation and exploring this implementation territory for us.

The DDC language (again, very much like Haskell, but focused on effect tracking and an overall different conceptual approach to purity) puts forth a similar solution. See the [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~benl/papers/thesis/lippmeier-impure-world.pdf thesis] section 2.7 - 2.7.4 pages 115 - 119


== Better name spacing ==

In Haskell, you can look at an occurrence of any identifier `f` or `M.f` and decide where it is bound without thinking about types at all.  Broadly speaking it works like this:
 * For qualified names, `M.f`, find an import that binds `M.f`.
 * For unqualified names, `f`, find the innermost binding of `f`; or, if that takes you to top level, look for top level binding of `f` or an import that binds `f`.
If there is ambiguity (eg two imports both import something called `f`) then an error is reported.  And that's what happens for the `Record` and `RecordClash` example above.

So the proposed solution for record field names is to specify more precisely which one you mean by using the type name. Note that a data declaration now creates a module-like namespace, so we aren't so much using the type name as using the data type namespace in the same way we use a module namespace.

So you could say `Record.a` or `RecordClash.a` rather than `a`, to specify which field selector you mean.  This creates a potential ambiguity: did you mean `<module-name>.f` or `<record-name>.f`.  `Record` could be the name of a type or of a module.

There are 2 cases to consider:
1) inside module M naming a record M, and also importing both that module and record
2) importing 2 different modules, M1 and M2, where M2 defines a record named M1.

The module/record ambiguity is dealt with in Frege by preferring modules and requiring a module prefix for the record if there is ambiguity. So for 1) you need M.M.field. For 2) you need M2.M1.field.

We could instead prefer a record rather than a module - this would normally be the desired behavior, but then we must figure out how to still be able to access the module. This is particularly the case for modules not marked as qualified - generally all modules are under a verbose namespace and the Module.identifier syntax is only used if the module is first qualified.

Generally, programmers will avoid this situation by doing what they do now: structuring their programs to avoid name collisions. We can try and give the greater assistance in this regard by providing simpler ways for them to alter the names of import types.

One way to avoid the Module.Record.x problem is to use type alias names, for example:

{{{
data InconvenientName = X { f :: Int }
type IN = InconvenientName
-- IN.f is the same as InconvenientName.f
}}}



== Getting rid of the Verbosity with the dot operator ==

We have name-spaces, but it is hard to see how this is better than the current practice of adding prefixes to record fields: `data Record = Record { recordA :: String }`

Verbosity is solved in Frege and DDC by using the dot syntax concept. In `data Record = Record {a::String};r = Record "A"; r.a` The final `r.a` resolves to `Record.a r`.

This is the TDNR syntax concept. See 'Simple Type Resolution' for how we resolve the type of this code.
Also see 'Details on the dot' for a lengthy discussion of the dot.


== Simple type resolution ==

Frege has a detailed explanation of the semantics of its record implementation, and the language is *very* similar to Haskell. After reading the Frege manual sections, one is still left wondering: how does Frege implement type resolution for its dot syntax. The answer is fairly simple: overloaded record fields are not allowed. So you can't write code that works against multiple record types. Please see the comparison with Overloading in [wiki:Records], which includes a discussion of the relative merits. Note that the DDC thesis takes the same approach.

Back to simple type resolution. From the Frege Author:

 * Expressions of the form T.n are trivial, just look up n in the namespace T.
 * Expressions of the form x.n: first infer the type of x. If this is just an unbound type variable (i.e. the type is unknown yet), then check if n is an overloaded name (i.e. a class operation). If this is not the case, then x.n is not typeable. OTOH, if the type of x can be inferred, find the type constructor and look up n in the associated name space.

Under no circumstances, however, will the notation x.n contribute in any way in inferring the type of x, except for the case when n is a class operation, where an appropriate class constraint is generated.

Note that this means it is possible to improve upon Frege in the number of cases where the type can be inferred - we could look to see if there is only one record namespace containing n, and if that is the case infer the type of x -- Greg Weber

So lets see examples behavior from the Frege Author:

For example, lets say we have:

{{{
data R = R { f :: Int }

bar R{f=42} = true
bar R{} = false

foo r = bar r || r.f==43
baz r = r.f==47 || bar r

foobaz r = r.f
}}}

Function bar has no difficulties, after desugaring of the record patterns it's just plain old pattern matching.

Function foo is also ok, because through the application of `r` to bar the type checker knows already that r must be an R when it arrives at `r.f`

Function baz is ok as long as the type checker does not have a left to right bias (Frege currently does have this bias, but will hopefully be improved).

The last function foobaz gives a type error too, as there is no way to find out the type of `r`.

Hence, the records in Frege are a very conservative extension to plain old algebraic data types, actually all record constructs will be desugared and reduced to non-record form in the way I have described in the language reference. For example, the data R above will become:

{{{
data R = R Int where
    f (R x) = x
    ...
}}}

To be sure, the where clause is the crucial point here. It puts f in the name space R. The global scope is not affected, there is nothing named f outside the R namespace.

The record namespace is searched only in 3 cases:
 * when some name is explicitly qualifed with `R`:   `R.f`
 * when the type checker sees `x.f` and knows that `x::R`
 * In code that lives itself in the namespace `R`, here even an unqualified `f` will resolve to `R.f` (unless, of course, if there is a local binding for `f`)

=== Increased need for type annotation ===

This is the only real downside of this proposal - most downsides discussed here are inherent to any records proposal. The Frege author says:

I estimate that in 2/3 of all cases one does not need to write `T.e x` in sparsely type annotated code, despite the fact that the frege type checker has a left to right bias and does not yet attempt to find the type of `x` in the code that "follows" the `x.e` construct (after let unrolling etc.) I think one could do better and guarantee that, if the type of `x` is inferrable at all, then so will be `x.e` (Still, it must be more than just a type variable.)


== Syntax for updates (in the Frege manual) ==

  * the function that updates field `x` of data type `T` is `T.{x=}`
  * the function that sets field x in a `T` to `42` is `T.{x=42}`
  * If `a::T` then `a.{x=}` and `a.{x=42}` are equivalent to `T.{x=} a` and `T.{x=42} a`
  * the function that changes field x of a T by applying some function to it is `T.{x <-}`

The function update syntax is a new addition to Haskell that we do not need to immediately implement.

=== Alternative update syntax: let syntax ===

As an example, we define a record type and value:
{{{
data R = R { ..., w :: W, x :: X, y :: Y, z :: Z, a :: A, ... }

r = R { ..., x = undefined, y = undefined, z = undefined, ... }
}}}

Then to change x, y, z, we write
{{{
let { r.x = x'; r.y = y'; r.z = z'; } in r
}}}

For brevity, if we allow tuples of selectors:
{{{
r.(x, y, z) = (r.x, r.y, r.z)
}}}

then one can simply write
{{{
let r.(x, y, z) = (x', y', z') in r   
}}}

Thus the language would be simpler (little/no new syntax to define),
and it would keep to the principle of Least Surprise (little/no new
syntax to learn).

I don't prefer this syntax because 1) I actually think is more surprising because it is very different from the current record syntax and 2) the updated value is not right next to the field, so it requires some mental translation. -- Greg Weber

== Interaction with Typeclasses ==

In the Frege system, the record's namespace is closed where it is defined.
However, making a record an instance of a type class lifts the class functions into the record name-space.

{{{
module RecordExtension where

import original.M(R)    -- access the R record defined in module original.M

class Rextension1 r where
      f :: .....
      g :: .....

instance Rextension1 R where
     -- implementation for new functions
}}}

the new functions `f` and `g` are accessible (only) through R.
So we have a technique for lifting new functions into the Record namespace.
For the initial records implementaion we would want to maintain `f` and `g` at the top-level, but should consider also adding through the record name-space. See related discussion below on future directions.

== Compatibility with existing records ==

The new record system would be enabled with `-XNAMESPACEDATA`.
Records from modules without this extension by default should still pollute the global namespace, even in a module using this extension. To make old records use the new style, one should add `-XNOGLOBALRECORDFIELDS`

Until this is a Haskell standard, we should try to avoid this being infectious. If I turn the extension on for my module and export a record, a user that wants to import the record should be able to use the old style. This would be the default if there is no `-XNAMESPACEDATA`, or should the user have to specify a different pragma and the default would be a compilation error forcing them to specify one or the other?

Ideally, with `-XNOGLOBALRECORDFIELDS` we would also be able to strip any now useless field prefixes.

{{{
module OldModule ( Record(..) ) where data Prefix = Prefix { prefixA :: String }

module NewModule where
import OldModule ( Prefix(..) strip prefix )

aFunc = let r = Prefix "A" in r.a
}}}


                                                                                





== Extending data name-spacing ==

This is mostly just something interesting to contemplate.

Dot syntax does not have to be limited to records (although it probably should be for the initial implementation until this new record system is vetted). I think it is a bad idea to attempt to attempt to extend the dot syntax to accomplish general function chaining through extending the dot syntax - we are simply asking too much of the dot right now. However, it is consistent to extend the function name-spaced to a record data type concept to any data type (as it is in Frege), and use dot syntax for that. The dot (without spaces) then *always* means tapping into a namespace (and simple type resolution).

Placing functions within a data name-space can make for nicer data-structure oriented code where the intent is clearer. It can help to achieve the data-oriented goal of OO (without the entanglement of state). With control over how the data namespace is exported (similar to controlling module namesapces), it is possible to create virtual record field setters and getters that can be accessed through dot syntax.

Both Frege and the DDC thesis take this approach.

In this brave new world (see above where typeclass functions are also placed under the namespace of the data), there are few functions that absolutlely must be at the top level of a module. Although a library author might take attempt the approach of no top-level functions, most library users will likely find it more convenient to define functions at the top level of modules rather than to always lift them into data structure name-spaces with typeclasses.
