The `OverloadedRecordFields` extension for GHC allows multiple record datatypes to share the same field names, and uses type information to disambiguate them. For more information, see:

 * [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Redesign Redesigned variant involving three extensions]
    * Part 1: [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/DuplicateRecordFields DuplicateRecordFields] (in GHC 8.0)
    * Part 2: [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/OverloadedLabels OverloadedLabels] (aimed for GHC 8.0)
    * Part 3: [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/MagicClasses Magic type classes] (will probably not make GHC 8.0)

The extension was implemented in 2013 as a Google Summer of Code project, by Adam Gundry under the mentorship of Simon Peyton Jones.
