The `OverloadedRecordFields` extension for GHC allows multiple record datatypes to share the same field names, and uses type information to disambiguate them. For more information, see:

 * [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Design Original design of the extension]
 * [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Redesign Redesigned variant involving three extensions] (being implemented as of March 2015)
 * [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Implementation Notes on the implementation]

== Code ==

The latest code is on the `wip/orf-new` branch of the `ghc` and `haddock` development repositories.  The forks of [https://github.com/adamgundry/ghc ghc], [https://github.com/adamgundry/packages-base packages-base] and [https://github.com/adamgundry/haddock haddock] have been superseded.

A [https://github.com/adamgundry/records-prototype prototype implementation] of the design is also available.

The design has mostly stabilised, but there is still some work to do on the implementation. See [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Implementation#Currentstatus notes for GHC hackers on the current status of the code].

== History ==

The extension was implemented in 2013 as a Google Summer of Code project, by Adam Gundry under the mentorship of Simon Peyton Jones.
