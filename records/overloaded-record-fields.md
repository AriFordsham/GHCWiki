# [OverloadedRecordFields](records/overloaded-record-fields)


The `OverloadedRecordFields` extension for GHC allows multiple record datatypes to share the same field names, and uses type information to disambiguate them. For more information, see:

- [Original design of the extension](records/overloaded-record-fields/design)
- [Redesigned variant involving three extensions](records/overloaded-record-fields/redesign) (being implemented as of March 2015)
- [Notes on the implementation](records/overloaded-record-fields/implementation)
- [ Adam Gundry's blog post](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/03/overloadedrecordfields-revived/)


Content previously on this page has been moved to the [SORF](records/overloaded-record-fields/sorf) page.

## Code


The latest code is on the `wip/orf-new` branch of the `ghc` and `haddock` development repositories.  The forks of [ ghc](https://github.com/adamgundry/ghc), [ packages-base](https://github.com/adamgundry/packages-base) and [ haddock](https://github.com/adamgundry/haddock) have been superseded.


A [ prototype implementation](https://github.com/adamgundry/records-prototype) of the design is also available.


The design has mostly stabilised, but there is still some work to do on the implementation. See [notes for GHC hackers on the current status of the code](records/overloaded-record-fields/implementation#current-status).

## History


The extension was implemented in 2013 as a Google Summer of Code project, by Adam Gundry under the mentorship of Simon Peyton Jones.
