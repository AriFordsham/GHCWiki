# [OverloadedRecordFields](records/overloaded-record-fields)


The `OverloadedRecordFields` extension for GHC allows multiple record datatypes to share the same field names, and uses type information to disambiguate them. For more information, see:

- [Redesigned variant involving three extensions](records/overloaded-record-fields/redesign)

  - Part 1: [DuplicateRecordFields](records/overloaded-record-fields/duplicate-record-fields) (in GHC 8.0)
  - Part 2: [OverloadedLabels](records/overloaded-record-fields/overloaded-labels) (aimed for GHC 8.0)
  - Part 3: [Magic type classes](records/overloaded-record-fields/magic-classes) (will probably not make GHC 8.0)

*Lennart*: I've implemented 2&3 in the Mu compiler, and I'll add some comments about it.

*Lennart*: The MagicClasses proposal is fundamentally broken, because it breaks abstraction.


If we have a data type `R` with a field `foo` of type `T`, then we generate `instance HasField "foo" R T`.
Since instances are silently exported and imported it means that this instance is now available in every module that somehow depends on the defining module.  This means that the `foo` field of `R` is now accessible everywhere.  There is no way to limit the scope of `foo` anymore.  This is really terrible.  Any record proposal that no longer allows abstract data types to be defined is broken.

*Adam*: I don't think so. We will only solve a `HasField` constraint automatically in modules that have the field in scope, and thus we can retain the same abstraction rules as normal Haskell. This is just like `Coercible`. We don't really generate and export instances, rather there is special behaviour in the constraint solver. See [discussion on representation hiding](records/overloaded-record-fields/design#representation-hiding) (which needs to be updated to the latest design).

## History


The extension was implemented in 2013 as a Google Summer of Code project, by Adam Gundry under the mentorship of Simon Peyton Jones.
