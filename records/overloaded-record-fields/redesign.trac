= Overloaded record fields: a modest proposal =

This is an attempt to redesign and clarify the design of the OverloadedRecordFields extension, in order to develop a plan for implementation.  It has benefited from the extensive discussion surrounding [wiki:Records/Volkov Nikita Volkov's record library].  The following design choices are not set in stone, but are intended as a concrete proposal for further discussion.  For reference, here is the [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Design previous design].


=== Use existing Haskell records ===

The `OverloadedRecordFields` extension permits existing Haskell records to overload field names.  Thus the following is legal in a single module:

{{{
data Person  = Person  { personId :: Int, name :: String }
data Address = Address { personId :: Int, address :: String }
}}}

While we might choose to add anonymous records later, they are not central to the design.  In particular, this means that

 * all existing features of Haskell datatypes, such as multiple constructors, strictness and unpacking, are supported unchanged;

 * abstraction and representation hiding work just as in normal Haskell: if a field selector is not exported, client code cannot observe it;

 * application code can use `OverloadedRecordFields` even with libraries that do not;

 * no new declaration syntax is added.

For each field in each record datatype, regardless of whether the extension is enabled, a selector function and an update function will be generated (at present, only a selector function is generated).


=== No changes to record selectors, construction or update ===

Bare uses of the field refer only to the selector function, and work only if this is unambiguous.  Thus, in the above example `name :: Person -> String` but bare use of `personId` leads to a name resolution error.  This means that turning on `OverloadedRecordFields` for an existing module is a conservative extension: since the module can have no duplicate field names, everything still works.  Moreover, changes to GHC's renamer should be minimal.  In addition, uses of fields that are always unambiguous (because they mention the constructor, e.g. construction and pattern-matching) may freely use duplicated names.

'''Design question''': an alternative is that when `OverloadedRecordFields` is turned on, we do not get even unambiguous selector functions at the top level. Would that be preferable?

We propose ''no change whatsoever to how Haskell 98 records are constructed'' (e.g. `MkT { x = 3, y = True }`). Moreover, we propose ''no change to how records are updated'', which remains monomorphic (e.g. `t { y = False }`).  If there are many `y` fields in scope, the type of `t` must fix which one is intended.  This is a soft spot, but there is really no way around it because Haskell's type-changing update requires modifying multiple fields simultaneously.

So how are we want to select and update overloaded fields?


=== Digression: implicit parameters ===

First, let's review Haskell's existing and long-standing ''[https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/other-type-extensions.html#implicit-parameters implicit parameters]''.
Here is how they work in GHC today.
 * There is a class `IP` defined thus in `GHC.IP`:
{{{
class IP (x :: Symbol) a | x -> a where
  ip :: a

-- Hence ip's signature is
--    ip :: forall x a. IP x a => a
}}}
 * When you write `?x` in an expression, what GHC does today is to replace it with `(ip @ "x" @ alpha)`, where `alpha` is a unification variable and `@` is type application.  (This isn't valid source Haskell, which doesnt have type application, but GHC certainly does have type application internally, so we don't need proxy arguments here.

 * Of course, that call `(ip @ "x" @ alpha)` gives rise to a constraint `IP "x" alpha`, which must be satisfied by the context.

 * The form `?x` in an expression is only valid with `{-# LANGUAGE ImplicitParameters #-}`

 * The pretty printer displays the constraint `IP x t` as `?x::t`.

 * The functional dependency `x->a` on class `IP` implements the inference rules for implicit parameters. (See the [http://galois.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pub_JL_ImplicitParameters.pdf orginal paper].)

 * There is some magic with implicit-parameter bindings, of form `let ?x = e in ...`, which in effect brings into scope a local instance declaration for `IP`.

And that's really about it.  The class `IP` is treated specially in a few other places in GHC.  If you are interested, grep for the string "`isIP`".


=== Implicit values ===

Now consider the following class:
{{{
class IV (x :: Symbol) a where
  iv :: Proxy# x -> a
}}}
(SLPJ note: if the `Proxy` argument isn't needed for implicit parameters, it should not be needed here either.)
Exactly like `IP` but without the functional dependency, and with a proxy argument so it can be called from user code.  The "`IV`" stands for "implicit values" (we can argue about the name later).  It behaves like this:

 * When you write `#x` in an expression, what GHC does is to replace it with `(iv @ "x" @ alpha) proxy#`, where `alpha` is a unification variable and `@` is type application.   Just like implicit parameters, in fact.

 * Of course the call `(iv @ "x" @ alpha)` gives rise to a constraint `(IV "x" alpha)` which must be satisfied by the context.

 * The form `#x` in an expression is only valid with `{-# LANGUAGE ImplicitValues #-}` (which is implied by `OverloadedRecordFields`).

 * The pretty printer prints `IV "x" t` as `#x::t`.

 * There is no functional dependency, and no equivalent to the implicit-parameter `let ?x=e` binding.  So implicit values are much less special than implicit parameters.

Notice that implicit values might be useful for all sorts of things that are nothing to do with records; that is why I don't mention "record" in their name.


=== Back to records ===

So does it have ''anything'' to do with records?  Yes, because of the `IV` instance for functions
{{{
instance HasField x r a => IV x (r -> a) where
  iv = getField
}}}
which would allow us to freely use `#x` as an overloaded record selector.  Thus:
{{{
xPlusOne r = #x r + 1::Int    -- Inferred type
                              -- xPlusOne :: HasField "x" r Int => r -> Int
}}}

Alternatively, we might choose to give this instance
{{{
instance (Functor f, FieldUpdate x s t a b) => IV x ((a -> f b) -> s -> f t) where
  iv p w s = setField p s <$> w (getField p s)
}}}
which would allow us to use `#x` as a lens that identifies record fields of that name, for example
{{{
f v = over #x (+1) v -- Inferred type
                     -- f :: (FieldUpdate "x" r r a a, Num a) => r -> r
}}}

In either case, lens libraries other than `lens`, which have data types for their lenses, could also give `IV`
instances and provide additional meanings to the `#x` syntax.  Lens library authors are free to experiment to their hearts' content with various sorts of lenes and lens generation.

'''Design question''': there are in fact a number of choices for the `(->)` instance for `IV`:

 1. provide an instance in base for `IV n (r -> a)`, allowing `#x` to be used as a selector function but requiring a combinator at the use site to convert it into a van Laarhoven lens;

 2. provide an instance in base for `IV n ((a -> f b) -> (r -> f s))`, allowing `#x` to be used as a van Laarhoven lens but requiring a combinator to convert it into a selector function;

 3. provide both instances in base, with some clever typeclass trickery to avoid incoherence (which is perfectly possible but might lead to confusing inferred types);

 4. provide neither instance in base, so use of `#x` as either a selector function or a van Laarhoven lens would require either an orphan instance or conversion via a combinator.


=== Magic classes ===

In order to write the `IV` instances for functions or lenses, we need some way to solve constraints of the form "type `r` has a field `x` of type `a`".  This is provided by the `HasField` and `FieldUpdate` classes:

{{{
-- | HasField x r means that r is a record type with a field x of type a
class HasField (x :: Symbol) r a | x r -> a where
  -- | Extract the field from the record
  getField :: Proxy# x -> r -> a

-- | FieldUpdate x s t a b means that s is a record type with a field x
--   of type a, that can be assigned a value of type b to produce a record type t
class HasField x s a => FieldUpdate (x :: Symbol) s t a b | x s -> a, x t -> b, x s b -> t, x t a -> s where
  setField :: Proxy# x -> s -> b -> t
}}}

These were previously called `Has` and `Upd`, but I suggest using longer and hopefully more meaningful names. There is substantial bikeshedding to be done about the details of these definitions (names, parameter number and order, whether to use functional dependencies or type families), but it should not substantially alter the proposal. These are the functional dependency based versions, for variety. Note that these classes correspond to the `FieldOwner` class in the `record` library.

We can imagine that GHC generates instances for each data type, like this:

{{{
data T = MkT { x :: Int }

instance HasField "x" T Int where
  getField _ (MkT x) = x

instance FieldUpdate "x" T T Int Int where
  setField _ (MkT _) x = MkT x
}}}

(Actually, rather than giving instances for these classes directly, they will be implicitly created by the typechecker as required (similarly to `Coercible`), so there is no code generation overhead for datatype definitions other than the existing selector functions and a small new updater function.)


=== Hand-written instances ===

It is perfectly fine to write instances of `HasField` or `FieldUpdate` yourself.  For example, suppose we have various types of geometric shapes.
{{{
data Triangle = Tri Float Float Float  -- Base, height, angle
data Circle   = Circle Float           -- Radius
}}}
Then we are free to say
{{{
instance HasField "area" Triangle Float where
   getField _ (Tri b h _) = 0.5 * b * h
instance HasField "area" Circle Float where
   getField _ (Circle r) = pi * r * r
}}}
Now `#area` behaves like a virtual record selector; it is not a field of `Circle` or `Triangle` but you can treat it just like one.


=== Syntax ===

'''Design question''': it's not absolutely necessary to use `#x` for a field.  Here are some alternatives:

* We could use `@x`, though that would prevent it being used for explicit type application (which is common practice in writing, even if the extension to permit it in Haskell syntax hasn't made much progress).

* We could say "if there is at least one data type in scope with a field `x`, then `x` is treated like `(iv @ "x" @ alpha)`".  But I hate it.  And it doesn't work for virtual fields like `#area` above.

* (Suggested by Edward K.)  We could define a magic module `GHC.ImplicitValues`, and say that if you say
{{{
import GHC.ImplicitValues( p, q, area )
}}}
  then all occurrences of `p`, `q`, `area` will be treated as implicit values (written `#p`, `#q`, `#area` above).  That has the merit that it works fine for virtual fields like `area`, and it removes the `#p` syntactic clutter.

  It leaves open questions.  If you declare a H98 record with fields `p`, etc, do you have to import `p` from `GHC.ImplicitValues` as well?  Presumably not?  What if you ''import'' such a record?

But ''neither of these exploit the similarity to implicit parameters''.
I really really like the similarity between the models, and I think it'd be a pity to lose it.
And would implicit parameters ''really'' be better (from a software engineering point of view) if we replaced `?x` notation with `import GHC.ImplicitParameters( x )`?

Note that the `#x` form only behaves specially if you have `ImplicitValues` or `OverloadedRecordFields` enabled. So existing libraries that use `#` as an operator will work fine.  If you want `OverloadedRecordFields` as well, you'll have to put a space between an infix `#` and its second argument, thus `(a # b)` not `(a #b)`.  But that's not so bad. And exactly the same constraint applies with `MagicHash`: you must put a space between the `a` and the `#`, not `(a# b)`.  I don't think this is a big deal.


=== Design extension: sugar for class constraints ===

This is not necessary to begin with, but we may want `r { x :: t }` to be syntactic sugar for `(HasField "x" r t)`, although this might conflict with syntax for anonymous records. This is easy to desugar in the typechecker, but it is slightly harder to re-apply the sugar in inferred types and error messages. A similar syntax for updates would be nice, but it's not clear what.

In general, it is hard to ensure that we get nice inferred types and error messages that don't mention the type families unless absolutely necessary.


=== Design extension: anonymous records ===

Everything here is orthogonal to, and entirely compatible with the Nikita anonymous-records story.
Nikita's `FieldOwner` becomes a use-case of `HasField(Lens)`, and without any further work a library like `record` can reuse its typeclass machinery in order to work seamlessly with the `#` syntax.  Anonymous records might well be a fine thing, but they are a ''separate'' thing, which is good.

Moreover, we could subsequently add a syntax for anonymous record types (for example `{| x :: Int, y :: Int |}`) which would be entirely compatible with the `#` syntax.

For example, the following should work fine:

{{{
f :: FieldUpdate "x" r r t t => r -> t
f r = view #x r

z :: [r| { x :: Int, y :: Int } |]
z = [r| { x = 3, y = 2 } |]

a :: Int
a = f z
}}}

For this to be possible, the `Record<n>` tuple datatypes defined by the `record` library would need to have instances for `HasField` and `FieldUpdate` that are polymorphic in the name of the field, like this:

{{{
data Record2 (n1 :: Symbol) v1 (n2 :: Symbol) v2 =
  Record2 v1 v2

instance HasField n1 (Record2 n1 v1 n2 v2) v1 where
  getField _ (Record2 x _) = x

instance HasField n2 (Record2 n1 v1 n2 v2) v2 where
  getField _ (Record2 _ x) = x
}}}

These correspond to the existing `FieldOwner` instances in the `record` library.


=== Implementation notes ===

'''Instances'''.  We said that the data type declaration
{{{
data T = MkT { x :: Int }
}}}
generates the instance
{{{
instance f ~ Int => HasField "x" T f where
  getField _ (MkT x) = x
}}}
but GHC doesn't ''actually'' have to generate and compile
a whole instance declaration.  It can simply have a
built-in constraint solving rule for `(HasField "x" T t)` where `x` is a field of data type `T`.
The programmer will not know or care, but it should remove a plethora of instances.

Similar special purpose rules in the solver deal with `(s ~ t)` and `(Coercible s t)` constraints.
It's easy to do.

Hand written instances are still useful though.

'''Selectors'''.  The above code shows the field-selection code as part of the instance declaration, but we may not want ot generate that code repeatedly (in the special-purpose solver).  Field selection may be less trivial than it looks in when we have UNPACK pragmas; e.g.
{{{
data T = MkT { x :: {-# UNPACK #-} !S }
data S = MkS {-# UNPACK #-} !Int Int
}}}
So we'll probably generate this:
{{{
$sel_T_x :: T -> S
$sel_T_x (MkT x) = x

instance (Int ~ f) => HasField "x" T f where
  getField _ = $sel_T_x

x = $sel_T_x   -- The H98 selector, when OverloadedRecordFields is not on
}}}


=== Reflections ===

An `IV` constraint is, in effect, rather like a (family of) single-method type classes.  Instead of
{{{
f :: Ix a => a -> a -> a -> Bool
f i u l = inRange (l,u) i
}}}
which uses only one method from `Ix`, you could write the finer-grained function
{{{
f :: (IV "inRange" ((a,a) -> a -> Bool))
  => a -> a -> Bool
f i u l = #inRange (l,u) i
}}}
Note that this example has nothing to do with records, which is part of the point.
Perhaps `IV` will find other uses.
It is rather reminiscent of Carlos Camaro's [http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~camarao/CT/ System CT].
