= Overloaded record fields: implementation notes =

Here be dragons. This page describes implementation details and progress on the implementation of [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Plan the overloaded record fields plan]. Development of the extension is taking place on forks of the [https://github.com/adamgundry/ghc ghc] and [https://github.com/adamgundry/packages-base packages-base] repositories (on branch 'overloaded-record-fields'). A [https://github.com/adamgundry/records-prototype/blob/master/RecordsPrototype.hs prototype implementation] is also available.

== The basic idea ==

The `Has` and `Upd` classes, and `GetResult` and `SetResult` type families, are defined in the module [https://github.com/adamgundry/packages-base/blob/overloaded-record-fields/GHC/Records.hs GHC.Records] in the `base` package.

Typechecking a record datatype still generates record selectors, but their names have a `$sel` prefix and end with the name of their type. Moreover, instances for the classes and type families are generated. For example,

{{{
data T = MkT { x :: Int }
}}}

generates

{{{
$sel_x_T :: T -> Int -- record selector (used to be called `x`)
$sel_x_T (MkT x) = x

$dfHasTx :: forall a . a ~ Int => Has T "x" a -- corresponds to the Has instance decl
$dfHasTx = Has { getField _ = $sel_x_T }

$dfUpdTx :: forall a . a ~ Int => Upd T "x" a -- corresponds to the Upd instance decl
$dfUpdTx = Upd { setField _ s e = s { x = e } }

axiom TFCo:R:GetResultTx : GetResult T "x" = Int   -- corresponds to the GetResult type family instance
axiom TFCo:R:SetResultTx : SetResult T "x" Int = T -- corresponds to the SetResult type family instance
}}}

== The naming of cats ==

=== `FieldLabel` ===

A field is represented by the following datatype, parameterised by the representation of names:

{{{
data FieldLbl a = FieldLabel {
      flOccName   :: OccName,   -- ^ Label of the field
      flSelector  :: a,         -- ^ Record selector function
      flInstances :: FldInsts a -- ^ Instances for overloading
    }

type FieldLabel = FieldLbl Name

data FldInsts a = FldInsts { fldInstsHas :: a
                           , fldInstsUpd :: a
                           , fldInstsGetResult :: a
                           , fldInstsSetResult :: a }
}}}

Every field has a label (`OccName`), selector, and names for the dfuns and axioms (currently stored together in the `FldInsts` record, but this could change). The `dcFields` field of `DataCon` stores a list of `FieldLabel`, whereas the `ifConFields` field of `IfaceConDecl` stores a list of `FieldLbl OccName`. The motivation for storing the names of the pieces is to avoid dragging `extendInteractiveContext` into the monad with `gresFromAvails`.


=== `AvailInfo` and `IE` ===

The new definition of `AvailInfo` is:

{{{
data AvailInfo      = Avail Name | AvailTC Name [Name] AvailFields
data AvailFlds name = NonOverloaded [name] | Overloaded [(OccName, name)]
type AvailFields    = AvailFlds Name
}}}

The `AvailTC` constructor represents a type and its pieces that are in scope. Record fields are now stored separately in the third argument. If the fields are not overloaded, we store only the selector names, whereas if they are overloaded, we store the labels as well. The `IEThingWith name [name] (AvailFlds name)` constructor of `IE` represents a thing that can be imported or exported, and also has a separate argument for fields.

Note that an `OccName` and parent is not enough to uniquely identify a selector, because of data families: if we have

{{{
module M ( F (..) ) where
  data family F a
  data instance F Int { foo :: Int }

module N ( F (..) ) where
  import M ( F(..) )
  data instance F Char { foo :: Char }
}}}

then `N` exports two different selectors with the `OccName` `"foo"`.


=== `Parent` and `GlobalRdrElt` ===

The `Parent` type has an extra constructor `FldParent Name OccName` that stores the parent `Name` and the field `OccName`. The `GlobalRdrElt` (`GRE`) for a field stores the selector name directly, and uses the `FldParent` constructor to store the field. Thus a field `x` of type `T` gives rise this entry in the `GlobalRdrEnv`:

{{{
x |->  GRE $sel_x_T (FldParent T x) LocalDef
}}}

Note that the `OccName` used when adding a GRE to the environment (`greOccName`) now depends on the parent field: for `FldParent` it is the field label rather than the selector name. Since `AvailInfo` does not store selectors for overloaded fields, `gresFromAvails` is now defined in the `TcRnIf` monad so that it can call `lookupOrig` to find the selectors. As a consequence of this, `GHC.getPackageModuleInfo` cannot call `gresFromAvails`, so it now returns `Nothing` in `minf_rdr_env`.


== Source expressions ==

The `HsExpr` type has extra constructors `HsOverloadedRecFld OccName` and `HsSingleRecFld OccName id`. When `-XOverloadedRecordFields` is enabled, and `rnExpr` encounters `HsVar "x"` where `x` refers to multiple `GRE`s that are all record fields, it replaces it with `HsOverloadedRecFld "x"`. When the typechecker sees `HsOverloadedRecFld x` it emits a wanted constraint `Has alpha x beta` and returns type `alpha -> beta` where `alpha` and `beta` are fresh unification variables.

When the flag is not enabled, `rnExpr` turns an unambiguous record field `foo` into `HsSingleRecFld foo $sel_foo_T`. The point of this constructor is so we can pretty-print the field name but store the selector name for typechecking.

Where an AST representation type (e.g. `HsRecField` or `ConDeclField`) contained an argument of type `Located id` for a field, it now stores a `Located RdrName` for the label, and some representation of the selector. The parser uses an error thunk for the selector; it is filled in by the renamer  (by `rnHsRecFields1` in `RnPat`, and `rnField` in `RnTypes`). The new definition of `ConDeclField` (used in types) is:

{{{
data ConDeclField name
  = ConDeclField { cd_fld_lbl  :: Located RdrName,
                   cd_fld_sel  :: name,
                   cd_fld_type :: LBangType name, 
                   cd_fld_doc  :: Maybe LHsDocString }
}}}

The new definition of `HsRecField` is:

{{{
data HsRecField id arg = HsRecField {
        hsRecFieldLbl :: Located RdrName,
        hsRecFieldSel :: Either id [(id, id)],
        hsRecFieldArg :: arg,
        hsRecPun      :: Bool }
}}}

The renamer (`rnHsRecFields1`) supplies `Left sel_name` for the selector if it is unambiguous, or `Right xs` if it is ambiguous (because it is for a record update, and there are multiple fields with the correct label in scope). In the latter case, the possibilities `xs` are represented as a list of (parent name, selector name) pairs. The typechecker (`tcExpr`) tries three ways to disambiguate the update:

1. Perhaps only one type has all the fields that are being updated.

2. Use the type being pushed in, if it is already a `TyConApp`. 

3. Use the type signature of the record expression, if it exists and is a `TyConApp`.


== Automatic instance generation ==

Typeclass and family instances are generated and typechecked by `makeOverloadedRecFldInsts` in `TcInstDecls`, regardless of whether or not the extension is enabled. This is called by `tcTopSrcDecls` to generate instances for fields from datatypes in the current group (just after derived instances, from '''deriving''' clauses, are generated). Overloaded record field instances are not exported to other modules (via `tcg_insts`), though underlying dfun ids and axioms are exported from the module as usual.

Since the instances are not in scope in the usual way, `matchClassInst` and `tcLookupFamInst` look for the relevant constraints or type families and find the instances directly, rather than consulting `tcg_inst_env` or `tcg_fam_inst_env`. They first perform a lookup to check that the field name is in scope. A new field `tcg_fld_inst_env` in `TcGblEnv` maps a selector name in the current module to its `DFunId`s and `FamInst`s; this is needed for solving constraints that arise while checking the automatically generated instances themselves.

'''AMG''' The instance lookup is currently implemented as a separate check, which means virtual fields should be forbidden. Perhaps it could be integrated into the existing overlapping instances mechanism, but type families need some care to avoid soundness bugs.


== Unused imports ==

Unused imports and generation of the minimal import list (`RnNames.warnUnusedImportDecls`) use a map from selector names to labels, in order to print fields correctly. Moreover, consider the following:

{{{
module A where
  data T = MkT { x,y:Int }

module B where
  data S = MkS { x,y::Bool }

module C where
  import A( T(x) )
  import B( S(x) )

  foo :: T -> Int
  foo r = r.x + 2
}}}

Now, do we expect to report the 'x' in S(x) import as unused?  Actually the entire 'import B' is unused.  Only the typechecker will eventually know that.

To record this, I've added a new field `tcg_used_selectors :: TcRef NameSet` to the `TcGblEnv`, which records the selector names for fields that are encountered during typechecking (when looking up a `Has` instance etc.). This set is used to calculate the import usage and unused top-level bindings. Thus a field will be counted as used if it is needed by the typechecker, regardless of whether any definitions it appears in are themselves used.

'''AMG''' One problem remains: typechecking the instances generated for a field counts as a use of that field! So all locally defined overloaded fields will be counted as used.



== Deprecated field names ==

Deprecations and fixity declarations look for a top-level name, so they cannot be applied to overloaded record fields. Perhaps this should change. Deprecations actually work by `OccName`, so we could make

{{{
{-# DEPRECATED foo "Don't use foo" #-}
}}}

apply to all the `foo` fields in a module, but there are difficulties in deciding when a deprecated field has been used similar to those for [#Unusedimports unused imports].


== GADT record updates ==

Consider the example

{{{
data W a where
    MkW :: a ~ b => { x :: a, y :: b } -> W (a, b)
}}}

It would be nice to generate

{{{
-- setField :: proxy "x" -> W (a, b) -> a -> W (a, b)
setField _ s e = s { x = e }
}}}

but this record update is rejected by the typechecker, even though it is perfectly sensible, because of #2595. The currently implemented workaround is instead to generate the explicit update

{{{
setField _ (MkW _ y) x = MkW x y
}}}

which is fine, but rather long-winded if there are many constructors or fields. Essentially this is doing the job of the desugarer for record updates.

Note that `W` does not admit type-changing single update for either field, because of the `a ~ b` constraint. Without it, though, type-changing update should be allowed.


== Data families ==

Consider the following:

{{{
data family F (a :: *) :: *
data instance F Int  = MkF1 { foo :: Int }
data instance F Bool = MkF2 { foo :: Bool }
}}}

This is perfectly sensible, and gives rise to two *different* record selectors `foo`, and corresponding `Has` instances:

{{{
instance t ~ Int => Has (F Int) "foo" t
instance t ~ Bool => Has (F Bool) "foo" t
}}}

Thus we use the name of the representation tycon, rather than the family tycon, when naming the record selectors: we get `$sel_foo_R:FInt` and `$sel_foo_R:FBool`. This requires a bit of care, because lexically (in the `GlobalRdrEnv`) the selectors still have the family tycon are their parent.

In order to have access to the representation tycon name in the renamer, it is generated by `getLocalNonValBinders` and stored in a new field `dfid_rep_tycon` of `DataFamInstDecl`. It would be nice if we could do the same for all the derived names, in order to localise the set of names that have been used (currently stored in the `tcg_dfun_n` mutable field). However, this is tricky:
* Default associated type declarations result in axioms being generated during typechecking.
* DFun names for instances of `Typeable` and the `Generics` classes are generated during typechecking.
We could work around this but it may not be worth the bother.


== Mangling selector names ==

We could mangle selector names (using `$sel_foo_T` instead of `foo`) even when the extension is disabled, but we decided not to because the selectors really should be in scope with their original names, and doing otherwise leads to:
  * Trouble with import/export
  * Trouble with deriving instances in GHC.Generics (makes up un-renamed syntax using field `RdrName`s)
  * Boot files that export record selectors not working


== Outstanding bugs ==

* typechecker/should_fail/tcfail102 (changed error message)


== To do ==

* When there is only one thing in scope, what should we do? See [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields/Plan#Scopeissuesorwhywemissdot discussion here].
* Add `HsVarOut RdrName id` instead of `HsSingleRecFld` (or perhaps rename `HsVar` to `HsVarIn`)? This would also be useful to recall how the user referred to something.

* Fix reporting of unused local field definitions.
* Only do magic instance lookup when the extension is enabled?
* Haddock omits fields from HTML index and prints selector names in LaTeX exports list.

* Consider syntactic sugar for `Upd` constraints.
* Improve unsolved `Accessor p f` error message where `p` is something silly?
* Consider defaulting `Accessor p` to `p = (->)`, and defaulting `Has r "f" t` constraints where there is only one datatype with a field `f` in scope.

* Document the extension.
