This page describes the `OverloadedLabels` extension, part 2 of the [wiki:Records/OverloadedRecordFields OverloadedRecordFields proposal].

=== Digression: implicit parameters ===

First, let's review Haskell's existing and long-standing ''[https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/other-type-extensions.html#implicit-parameters implicit parameters]''.
Here is how they work in GHC today.
 * There is a class `IP` defined thus in `GHC.IP`:
{{{
class IP (x :: Symbol) a | x -> a where
  ip :: a

-- Hence ip's signature is
--    ip :: forall x a. IP x a => a
}}}
 * When you write `?x` in an expression, what GHC does today is to replace it with `(ip @ "x" @ alpha)`, where `alpha` is a unification variable and `@` is type application.  (This isn't valid source Haskell, which doesnt have type application, but GHC certainly does have type application internally, so we don't need proxy arguments here.

 * Of course, that call `(ip @ "x" @ alpha)` gives rise to a constraint `IP "x" alpha`, which must be satisfied by the context.

 * The form `?x` in an expression is only valid with `{-# LANGUAGE ImplicitParameters #-}`

 * The pretty printer displays the constraint `IP x t` as `?x::t`.

 * The functional dependency `x->a` on class `IP` implements the inference rules for implicit parameters. (See the [http://galois.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pub_JL_ImplicitParameters.pdf orginal paper].)

 * There is some magic with implicit-parameter bindings, of form `let ?x = e in ...`, which in effect brings into scope a local instance declaration for `IP`.

And that's really about it.  The class `IP` is treated specially in a few other places in GHC.  If you are interested, grep for the string "`isIP`".


=== Overloaded labels ===

Now consider the following class:
{{{
class IsLabel (x :: Symbol) a where
  fromLabel :: a
}}}
Exactly like `IP` but without the functional dependency. It is also rather similar to a version of the `IsString` class from `OverloadedStrings`, but with an additional parameter making the string available at the type level.

It behaves like this:

 * When you write `#x` in an expression, what GHC does is to replace it with `(fromLabel @ "x" @ alpha)`, where `alpha` is a unification variable and `@` is type application.   Just like implicit parameters, in fact.

 * Of course the call `(fromLabel @ "x" @ alpha)` gives rise to a constraint `(IsLabel "x" alpha)` which must be satisfied by the context.

 * The form `#x` in an expression is only valid with `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedLabels #-}` (which is implied by `OverloadedRecordFields`).

 * The pretty printer could print `IsLabel "x" t` as `#x::t` ('''AMG''': I don't plan to implement this initially).

 * There is no functional dependency, and no equivalent to the implicit-parameter `let ?x=e` binding.  So overloaded labels are much less special than implicit parameters.

Notice that overloaded labels might be useful for all sorts of things that are nothing to do with records; that is why they don't mention "record" in their name.

User code can never (usefully) call `fromLabel` (or `ip`) directly, because without explicit type application there is no way to fix `x`.
