== Drawbacks ==

The most important drawbacks of this design relative to other designs are:

 * Lack of support for type-changing update
 * Lack of support for strict and unpacked fields
 * Lack of support for polymorphic (Rank-N) fields
 * Fixed limit on the number of fields (24 in the current implementation)

Also, it is questionable whether any record extension should bake in a particular lens type.
