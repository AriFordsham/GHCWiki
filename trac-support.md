# Trac Support


Like in most [ open source projects](http://www.opensource.org/), "free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [ mailing list](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/MailingList) and the project wiki.


There is also an [ IRC channel](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/IrcChannel), where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.


Before you start a new support query, make sure you've done the appropriate searching:

- in the project's [ FAQ](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracFaq)
- in past messages to the Trac [ Mailing List](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.trac.general?set_user_css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edgewall.com%2Fcss%2Fgmane.css&do_set_user_css=t)
- in the Trac ticket system, using either a [ full search](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/search?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on) or a [ ticket query](http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/query?summary=~&keywords=~").
