= A description of the Haddock comment support in GHC =
Haddock comment support was added to GHC as part of a [http://code.google.com/soc Google Summer Of Code] project. The aim of the project was to  port the existing Haddock program to use the GHC API. The project is now over -- GHC can understand Haddock comments and they are available through the GHC API.
