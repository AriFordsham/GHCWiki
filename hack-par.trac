= Parallel Haskell Hackathon =

== Organisation ==

Dates : 10-12 December

Location : St Andrews

== Participants ==
Vladimir Janjic (Host), Hans-Wolfgang Loidl, Kevin Hammond, Mustafa Aswad, Henrique Ferreiro Garcia, Philip W Trinder, Patrick Maier, Abyd Al Zain, Mischa Dieterle, Thomas Horstmeyer, Jost Berthold, Simon Marlow (virtual),

== Source code ==
Important: if you can, please prepare a setup of the latest sources in advance.
A darcs repository has been set up on the server in Marburg, please read here how to get a working setup: [http://james.mathematik.uni-marburg.de:8080/EdenWiki/DarcsRepoCheatSheet Repository Briefing].

You should contact Mischa (dieterle@mathematik...) in order to get access, or check out read-only via http (which is of course not what we want later).
If you have questions or problems, edit the page or mail Jost (berthold@mathematik...)

== Agenda ==

Topics to cover in the Hackathon:

 * Short overview sessions on implementation internals (KH: these should not all be on the first afternoon!):
  * GUM (Mustafa)
  * Eden (Jost)
  * Globus (Abyd)
  * Migration/Load Balancing (Vladimir)
  * ghc HEAD developments (Simon)
  * GUM/Eden Compilation and Debugging (Vladimir?)
 * GUM-6 port
 * Merging GUM and Eden implementations
  * Packing code
  * Scheduler
  * GC interface
  * Tagging
 * Usage of new tracing infrastructure
 * Development infrastructure
  * Unified revision control (darcs)
  * Debugging infrastructure
  * Packaging
  * Setup for automatic tests
 * Parallel nofib-suite
 * Planned extensions and applications
  * Integration with GHC/SMP
  * Integrating migration
  * Globus interface
  * pre-SCSCP GAP interface
  * Micro-kernel/substrate approach to the RTS
 * Nominating people in charge of sub-projects
  * parallel nofib suite
  * Eden/GUM code maintenance
  * testing framework
 * Prize for the most awkward bug fixed in the Hackaton. ,,~~Jost: I am non-competitive in this contest, since my task is to introduce them ;)~~,, ,,~~HWL: Clearly you are at an disadvantage: you first have to introduce the bug; we don't have that problem;-)~~,,

== Expected Outcomes ==

 * Unified repository, containing Eden and GUM code
 * Common test platform
 * List of people in charge of sub-projects

== Agenda proposals ==

JB: I suggest a more informal format than real talks. 
 * Practical Code Knowledge: One person gives informative overview and points to relevant source code, followed/interrupted by time slots to look up and read the code. 
 * Brainstorm: One person presents ideas (slides, black/white board, ???) about future features and development, and is chairing a discussion round afterwards. After discussion, results have to be fixed in keywords, within 5 minutes.
